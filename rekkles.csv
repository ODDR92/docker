Rekkles reunites with former G2 teammate in Fnatic for LEC 2023,
,"Swedish pro player Martin “Rekkles” Larsson is back in the League of Legends EMEA Championship (LEC) and will be part of Fnatic’s starting roster for LEC 2023.

He previously played in the Ligue Française de League of Legends (LFL) for Karmine Corp for a year in 2022.

Rekkles will play alongside support Rúben “Rhuckz” Barbosa in the bot lane, as well as Iván “Razork” Martín Díaz, mid laner Marek “Humanoid” Brázda, and top laner Martin “Wunder” Hansen, his former G2 Esports teammate.

Rhuckz is Fnatic’s newest support following Zdravets “Hylissang” Iliev Galabov’s departure from the team.

Rekkles returns to Fnatic for LEC 2023

Rekkles kicked off his career in Fnatic in 2012, and has helped the team claim six LEC championship titles.

He parted ways with the organization in 2020 to join G2 Esports.

While their first few games were promising, G2 ultimately had a disappointing 2021 season. This resulted in G2 founder Carlos “ocelote” Rodriguez benching and trading half of its roster, including Mihael “Mikyx” Mehle, Wunder, and Rekkles.

The AD carry soon found a home in Karmine Corp (KCorp) and moved to the LFL in 2022, where he helped the team earn its third EU Masters championship.

Fnatic’s announcement video showed the bot laner entering the organization’s headquarters and interacting with his teammates and staff.

“His personal goals align with what we are looking to achieve in 2023 and we’re confident on what comes next,” Fnatic said in an official statement.

Playing alongside Rekkles in the bot lane is rookie Rhuckz, a former member of Fnatic TQ, the organization’s LoL academy team.

He became Fnatic’s seventh player during Worlds 2022 after their previous bot lane tandem, Elias “Upset” Lipp and Zdravets Iliev “Hylissang” Galabov, tested positive for COVID-19.

“I didn’t expect to say this but, after so many years, it’s finally happening,” he wrote on his Twitter account. “I will be playing in the LEC next year with this insane team!”

Following Jakob “YamatoCannon” Mebdi’s departure from the team, the roster will be coached by Gonçalo “Crusher” Pinto, who was previously the head coach of Fnatic TQ. Former Misfits Gaming strategic coach Aleksi “Hiiva” Kaikkonen will join him to lead the team’s coaching staff.

German bot laner Elias “Upset” Lipp is still contracted with the organization, as his contract with Fnatic only expires in November 2023.

“Sadly the circumstances around this offseason did not allow me to go to one of my desired places to compete,” he tweeted.

Rekkles reportedly returning to Fnatic,
,"In the latest twist of a shocking offseason, Martin “Rekkles” Larsson is reportedly rejoining Fnatic as their LEC AD Carry for the 2023 season.

Rekkles reportedly returns to the LEC after a year in the LFL – Timo Verdeil

According to a rumor from Brieuc Seeger, Rekkles will rejoin the organization where he has spent most of his career. After brief stints with the org between 2012 and 2014, Rekkles became Fnatic’s starting AD Carry in 2015. He spent the next five years with the team, reaching the final of the 2018 World Championship.

However, Rekkles left Fnatic to join rivals G2 ahead of the 2021 season. His sole campaign with G2 ended at the hands of Fnatic, causing G2 to miss Worlds and bench Rekkles. The Swede spent the 2022 season with Karmine Corp in France’s LFL. The year was a mixed on, with the team winning EU Masters in Spring but finishing sixth in the LFL in Summer. With various reports swirling, Rekkles was reportedly advertising his openness to roleswap as recently as November 5.

Rekkles headlining Fnatic 2023: Too good to be true?

Jaxon was able to independently confirm the rumor that Rekkles was returning to Fnatic, but was unable to confirm that a deal had been agreed upon between Fnatic and Karmine Corp. The return of Rekkles would be the perfect roster move for many Fnatic fans.

Furthermore, the move would see the end of the AD Carry tenure of current starter Elias “Upset” Lipp. However, if Seeger’s reporting proves accurate, it would provide Fnatic with a major veteran presence in the bot lane. Blix.gg previously reported that Fnatic would be promoting Rúben “rhuckz” Barbosa to the support position from their Academy team. This comes after rhuckz proved himself with clutch substitute performances at Worlds 2022.

No deals or roster moves can be confirmed until free agency begins later in November. The Fnatic faithful will be left with baited breath until then to see if Rekkles is really coming home."
Rekkles reportedly returning to Fnatic for LEC 2023,
,"Following a year with G2 and a year outside the LEC with Kcorp, Rekkles is reportedly making his return to the LEC on the team that he built his career with: Fnatic.

Martin ‘Rekkles’ Larsson is one of the most accomplished ADC players in the West. Through his 5 year run with Fnatic, Rekkles managed to bring the team a great deal of success both domestically and internationally.

Among his greatest achievements are being a Finalist at Worlds 2018, a Semifinalist at Worlds 2015, as well as several podium finishes, with almost every regular season run for this player ending with him being third place or better.

But, after Fnatic got reverse-swept by Top Esports at Worlds 2020, he left the team and went to G2 for 2021.

Now, after spending 2 years on other teams, Rekkles will reportedly be flying the Fnatic banner once again for his return to the LEC in 2023

Rekkles reportedly returns to Fnatic for LEC 2023

A lot has happened for Rekkles since he left Fnatic for G2 in 2021. His run with the team was wasn’t bad by any means, but he wasn’t dominating the LEC. The iconic bot laner only took third place in the Spring Playoffs, and just narrowly missed Worlds in Summer 2021. He didn’t perform poorly, but he didn’t make G2 the best team in the world.

In the end, this would lead to G2 benching him, and the beginning of contract buyout woes.

Rekkles had an in-depth discussion about his time with G2 and Kcorp on stream

And, according to Rekkles, he was only earning 6% of his salary after he got benched by G2. Knowing that he “had to leave G2”, he went to Kcorp after his contract buyout was lowered. His time on Kcorp had a bitter end, with him getting knocked out of the LFL Summer Playoffs early on.

Following his year in the LFL, Rekkles was debating a roleswap to support if it’d get him on a good LEC team. Now, early reports have indicated that Rekkles will be returning to Fnatic as their ADC.

Article continues after ad

This news follows a saga of Rekkles’ personal accounts of his contract issues with G2. Along with the drastically reduced pay he discussed on stream, he also claimed that Kcorp had a buyout of their own placed on Rekkles contract.

He said that it’s “not as simple as just going to any team. I actually have multiple options again right now, but the buyout situation last year and the buyout situation now is a big problem for everything.”

Article continues after ad

With Fnatic’s currently signed ADC, Elias ‘Upset’ Lipp, reporting that he’s been left without a team for 2023, it’s even more likely that Rekkles will be signed with the organization.

The list of teams with enough cash to take a risk on Rekkles and pay to buy him out of his contract isn’t a long one. But Fnatic is a team on that list, and, if these early reports come to fruition, it’d put this star ADC player right back on the team that he found so much success with."
Rekkles Returns to Fnatic for LEC 2023,
,"The return of Rekkles, one of the most prominent names in Western League of Legends, to Fnatic is confirmed for the org's LEC 2023 roster.

Fnatic LoL LEC 2023 Roster

Fnatic announced the return of Rekkles and the rest of the squad via their official LEC 2023 Roster Announcement.

Top Lane

Martin Nordahl “Wunder” Hansen will remain as Fnatic's top laner. Known as one of the most consistent top laners in the league, Wunder joined Fnatic late 2021 and has been playing for the team for two splits. According to the Global Contract Database, his contract with the organization does not end until after the 2024 season.

Iván Martín “Razork” Díaz will also continue playing for Fnatic in the upcoming 2023 season.

Marek “Humanoid” Brázda joined Fnatic as part of their top side rebuild, alongside Wunder and Razork. The GCD says that all of their contracts end after the 2024 season, and it seems that the org is now focusing on the bot side this time.

Bot Lane

As reported by Brieuc “LEC Wooloo” Seeger via a tweet, Martin “Rekkles” Larsson will be making a return to the LEC as Fnatic's bot laner once again. As one of the most distinguished names in Western League of Legends, Rekkles started his professional career in 2012. He found himself in multiple teams over the years before he stayed in Fnatic in May 2015. He would go on to wear orange for over five years, and soon he became synonymous with the org. It was no surprise that his signing to rival team G2 Esports caused waves of shock, and even more when he moved on to play for the LFL team Karmine Corp in 2022.

He will be taking the place of Elias “Upset” Lipp, who took Rekkles' spot in Fnatic upon the latter's departure. Upset has not been reported to be playing for an LEC team in the upcoming year.

Support

Unfortunately, the addition of Rekkles seems to mean the loss of another long-time player. Rúben “Rhuckz” Barbosa is reportedly being promoted to the main Fnatic LoL roster, taking the place of Zdravets “Hylissang” Galabov who has been Fnatic's support since 2017. Rhuckz joined the Fnatic academy team this year and was called up to play for the main team in Worlds 2022 due to both Upset and Hylissang testing positive for COVID-19.

Hylissang is joining MAD Lions for this year following Rhuckz' promotion."
Rekkles,
,"Martin ""Rekkles"" Larsson (born September 20, 1996) is a Swedish player who is currently on the inactive roster of Fnatic.

History [ edit ]

Rekkles began his esports career in 2012 and despite short stints with other teams, he has been with Fnatic for the majority of his career to date - 8 years. With this organization he also achieved the greatest successes. The best year was undoubtedly 2018, where with Fnatic he won both the spring and summer splits, played in the semifinals of the Mid-Season Invitational 2018 and became runner-up of the World Championship 2018, losing in the grand final to Invictus Gaming. He played almost 600 games for Fnatic and won the LEC a total of 4 times, he also played in 7 international S-Tier tournaments (6 World Championships and 1 Mid-Season Invitational)

After such a long time in Fnatic and the expiration of his contract in 2020, Rekkles joined G2 Esports. He spent 1 year there, placing 3rd in the 2021 Spring Split and 4th in the 2021 Summer Split, respectively. In both splits he was placed on the 1st All-Pro Team roster, also winning the MVP award in the spring split. On November 16th 2021, Rekkles began a new chapter in his career and joined Karmine Corp. During his first split in LFL they finished 3rd, but Karmine Corp went on to win the EU Masters 2022 Spring tournament. In the summer split the results were no longer so satisfactory. They finished 6th in the LFL and failed to qualify for the EU Masters 2022 Summer.

Rekkles and Karmine Corp's plan was to play together in the LEC in 2023, but the team failed to buy a slot. So Rekkles started looking for options in other teams playing in the LEC. On 15 December 2022, he officially reached an agreement with Fnatic and once again returned to his home organisation.

On 28 April, after 12 years of playing pro as an Ad Carry, he made decision for roleswap to Support. Fnatic decided not to field him on the main roster for the LEC Summer 2023 split. Thus Rekkles sat on the bench as Support.

Rumour: Rekkles to Return to Fnatic's LoL Roster in 2023,
,"At this point it's a toxic relationship, right? League of Legends star player Rekkles will once again join Fnatic according to sources. Where will Upset go though?

League of Legends: Rekkles back in the LEC?! | © Riot Games

Fnatic didn't have the easiest summer split, barely making it into the LEC Playoffs to try and qualify for the 2022 League of Legends World Championship. Sure, their playoff run was impressive with bot laner Upset popping off on picks like Zeri, but then Fnatic faltered right at the end.

The World Championship also didn't go their way which means the team is looking for some major changes. Will bringing back Rekkles really be the answer to the team's success in 2023?

League of Legends: Rekkles to Make His LEC Comeback on Fnatic

Rekkles has been pretty outspoken about his return to the LEC throughout the League of Legends World Championship while streaming and making content regarding the biggest esports event. He gave some insights into his time on G2 Esports, going as far as to say that the team f*cked him over.

He's also expressed his desire to return to the LEC, even saying he would play in the support role. Well, now according to sources, it seems like this will become a reality, with Rekkles likely to come back to the professional scene. The team he will play on? Fnatic.

Which Fnatic Players Are Likely to Return in 2023?

According to Esportsmaniacos, some rumours have begun to float around regarding the composition of the 2023 LEC squad. Some players will stay, while others seem to be looking for new teams and new opportunities at the highest level of play in Europe.

So, which players will return? Jungler Razork, who has been one of the strongest performers, and is still very young, will likely be around in 2023. He will keep his solo laners by his side as well with both Wunder and Humanoid rumoured to stick with Fnatic in the next season.

Now this is a pick I've been raving about for way too long! Finally, its value has come to light:

Players and Staff Likely to Leave Fnatic

With the likely return of Rekkles to the bot lane it seems like Upset will have to look for a new home in 2023. The bot laner helped catapult Fnatic to the World Championship, but he underperformed in the second week of the event, causing the team to be eliminated in the group stage already.



Support player Hylissang is also out of Fnatic next year if the leaks from Esportsmaniacos are to be believed. Hylissang has been a part of the roster since 2017 and has the longest tenure on Fnatic. His contract is also until 2023, but it seems it will be terminated early.

Fnatic head coach YamatoCannon might also be leaving the squad and joining a new venture. He's coached multiple teams before, even coaching in the LCK a while ago. It is rumoured that he could be heading to the LCS for a new coaching position.

These are just rumours for now, but it seems like Fnatic could be a very different team in 2023. With the return of Rekkles we could see the entire team chemistry shift around. What do you think of this change?"

Yes, you read right, and this time it seems to actually be true. Rekkles is set to return to Fnatic in 2023.

Rekkles used to be the face of Fnatic for a long time. Not only was he the longest-serving member of the organization, but he was also known for bringing his team to new heights throughout his career.

His leave from Fnatic to join their biggest rivals, G2 Esports, was a big surprise for many, and many Fnatic fans were disappointed. Rekkles' change of team was, in fact, such a big deal that the LEC casters even decided to make a song for the occasion:

Two years later, it seems like everything is forgiven. Fnatic just announced their roster for the upcoming 2023 season and Rekkles is starting, but in which position?

This is not the first time Rekkles left Fnatic to join another team. All the way back in the spring split of 2015, Rekkles chose team Elements instead of Fnatic. However, the results were not what the Swedish ADC was hoping for, and the team finished 7-11 after the season.

What do you think about the return of Rekkles? Honestly, the return gives off some toxic relationship vibes, where one side continues to cheat on the other part, and they keep forgiving him every time he shows some interest... IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON, FNATIC.

LoL: Complete Fnatic Roster For 2023 Season Announced



Fnatic have just revealed who is going to be playing along with Rekkles. Three players of the 2022 roster will be returning to their original positions, while the bot lane of Fnatic is going to be completely shook up and new.

Despite surprising many during their LEC playoffs run, many fans started doubting the Fnatic roster after barely qualifying for the European Playoffs this summer and after their disappointing Worlds performance. Looking towards next year, we ask which of the players are likely to stay on Fnatic for another year.

Throughout the years, Fnatic has made quite a name for itself in the European league. Since the beginning of the LEC, Fnatic holds the second-most titles, only behind G2 Esports.

Fnatic was also the first team in Europe to make it to the Worlds Finals back in 2018 against Invictus gaming, where Fnatic lost 3-0 (Fnatic also won the first World Championship, but because of the lack of regions attending, it did not really count).

Fnatic was the team in Europe until G2 Esports took their place. Throughout its years, Fnatic has been a part of creating some memorable names like Huni, Febiven, Caps, Bwipo, Nemesis, Hyllisang, and, last but not least, Rekkles.

Even with great results, Upset and Hylissang have left the org, with Hyli finding a new home with the MAD Lions, while Upset is team-less.
