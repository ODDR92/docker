,"The following is a transcript of an interview with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon that aired Sunday, Dec. 11, 2022, on ""Face the Nation.""

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm so glad, first of all, that we're finally doing this.

JAMIE DIMON: I'm thrilled too, I know it's been a while.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So let's start off with why we're here. Why is America's best known banker in an inner city, low income neighborhood in Baltimore?

DIMON: I think it's a- it's a kind of a microcosm of banks do, which is to lift up society. So most people think of us as an investment bank and a private bank and commercial bank, and we do all those things. But we also bank you know, at 25%, of our branches are in lower income neighborhoods, and we want to lift them up too. And so this is branch here is a uni-, we're brand- we're new to Maryland. So we're now in 48 states. 30% of the branches here in lower income neighborhoods. They're in communities. We work with local government folks, local not for profits, then you show the mayor, governor-elect, what do they need and we call it a community branch, means the community manager gets to know all of the local folks - the churches, the schools, the businesses, and we invite people in for education about mortgages, wealth, starting a business, etc. We use local vendors for food to build the place. We hire locally, so their paychecks going out in the local neighborhood. And you can see the spirit of the people. I mean, it's very uplifting. And so it's just part of what we do. And then we come into town. We bring everything else to government for not for profit banking, we bank cities, schools, states hospitals. So it's just a wonderful way to help lift up communities. And it's extremely critical for America to focus on helping the underprivileged. I think it's a mistake to just drive by and say that's not our problem.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Mhmm.

DIMON: And so you see a lot of companies doing it. I'm proud of all the people to do it. And it's good for business. I mean, if you lift up society, it hurts- it helps everybody.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's what I want to ask you. Because you've done this now in Detroit, you've done this here, you've done it in parts of Dallas. You're not a charity, you're doing this for profit.

DIMON: Yeah. So people look at that there's a little piece of charitable money, which sometimes I call an accelerator.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Mhm.

DIMON: So if you can put that little piece of charity and on top that you can build $100 million of loans. But , but it's not done for charities, it's got to be sustainable. Things which aren't sustainable don't work very well. And so- But once we've got collaboration with local government, we're here, we- we intend to make a profit here and open accounts here and do things like that. Like I said, if you lift up Baltimore, it lifts up every business here. It lifts up all the people. you have more jobs, more wages, better social outcomes, better real estate value, so it's critical we do it and it is very good for business in the long run. And if everyone did it, you know, it'd be very good for all of America.

MARGARET BRENNAN: If everybody did this?

DIMON: If everyone - and a lot companies- (crosstalk)

BRENNAN: Bank of America's across the street over there, is that where- where you're talking about?

DIMON: Well I'm not going to mention any competitors, but this is a much nicer looking branch.

(Both laugh)

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when you - I mean, just fundamentally - when you, when you lend money, both parties are at risk. So in coming in here, JP Morgan has to change some of the parameters because you're reaching people who are unbanked.

DIMON: Yes

MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you know if someone is credit worthy If they've never owned a home, they've never had a bank account? How do you know you're making a good bet?

DIMON: It's a great question. So when you try, when you're here and you ask and you know the neighborhoods and you work with government, you do multiple things, So we do special things. We have- we call special credit, I won't go through legal parameters, but you can do - use other facts that are not used in traditional underwriting, like do you- have you paid rent for 10 years? So you and I would both say, if there is a mother or father or family paying rent for 10 years, that's a good credit sign, so we take a little bit of a stretch on that.

And so we live and learn, and so you can use a lot of data to do that. The government here, realize when it comes to lifting up neighborhoods, you can't do- you can't have a block where 50 homes, you know, 50 townhouses are bad or destroyed, and 50 are occupied. You have to lift all of them up.

So the government here came up with a very special program, to put in the seed money to rehab-fit the whole block. Once they rehab the whole block, we can step in and start making mortgages. So people can buy the homes and live there. And so there are- there are multiple paths to do it. On the entrepreneur of color fund that we do with small businesses, you know, we get- we give them an advisor too.That gives us great comfort that they're doing the right things.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've been critical in the past, though of government-backed lenders like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for their role in the last crisis and, and loosening up the ability to take loans. This was all at that time well intended -

DIMON: Yes

MARGARET BRENNAN: -to boost homeownership

DIMON: Yes (crosstalk)

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you can have a good intention and fix it wrong (crosstalk)

DIMON: You're absolutely correct. You know, things done badly are bad. And so there are a lot of examples where lenders did the wrong thing and the case banks and stuff like that, but we test, we learn, we test, we learn. And so this - these are not government programs, these are programs that we do that we're pretty comfortable doing a good thing. Do we take extra risk. Yes, but that's part of our job. We've banked venture capital companies, we bank startups, we bank a lot of people. We're adults, we're big boys, we know that their credit cycles thing go up or down.

So we're not taking so much risk that it's going to sink a company. Remember, Fannie and Freddie went bankrupt. The government paid, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars in that. And the other thing there by the way is some of the underwriting was hidden. People didn't actually know what other people - with people were doing in the underwriting which is not the case you here.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So the overall intent of boosting homeownership you believe is really important?

DIMON: Yes.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But in this moment we're in right now - you have mortgage rates -what? About 7%?

DIMON: 6 1/2 % yeah

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, right around there. It's hard to get access, but the Fed's also trying to cool off a housing market bubble.

DIMON: Yeah

MARGARET BRENNAN: So why try -

DIMON: Another good question. We look right through that - so this isn't we're not doing this and pulling in or pulling out our horns because the markets are good or bad. This is, you get to a community, you start doing it.

So obviously, we're probably making less mortgages now because of higher rates, but we're in the community, we're gonna have loan officers in the community, we're gonna learn more about the community. And we will look past the actual rates. And remember the important thing about mortgages - and this is why I do criticize some public policy sometimes - mortgages are how most Americans got their their net worth. And if you can't get a smaller mortgage to buy a house, it's hard to build your net worth. Mortgages are also, by the way, how often people funded their small business startup. So it is absolutely critical.

And you know one of the things we've been trying to change a little bit is because of all excessive rules now, and I'm not talking about things would make risk worse about origination, servicing, securitization, the cost of a small mortgage is probably 50 basis points higher than it should be. So that $150,000 mortgage or $200,000 mortgage is less affordable by a lot of people. And that's because of regulatory policy. That's not because of bank policy. And so, you know, I think there are things that could be done that can make mortgages far more affordable.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, if but you're saying not at this moment, you're not necessarily expecting- (crosstalk)

DIMON: No they should change that right now. Yeah.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So bigger picture on this effort right now, you said it's important to be trying to do things to address and build up communities. So if you're trying to combat discrimination, boost racial equity, that's admirable. But the other side of the coin is a critic would say a big bad Wall Street bank is loading debt onto poor people. How do you respond to that? Because-

DIMON: That's a fairly ignorant person

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-

DIMON: We-

MARGARET BRENNAN: You just spent a lot of time in Washington, I'm sure you have heard a lot of criticism of Big Bad banks (crosstalk)

DIMON: But that's a different issue. We're not trying to load debt on anyone. And yes, I hear about big bank banks, but we're here, we're doing jobs. We want to make good mortgages, we want to do good small business loans, you want to educate people how to open an account, how to save money, we've got products that are special for lower income communities-

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right

DIMON: We are going to do that. It is good for this community. If this community does better, it's good for this community. It doesn't hurt any other community. In fact, it helps them.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But how do you reassure folks who say the lender shouldn't be the educator?

DIMON: Well we're educating them about how to save money

MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what those classes are about? (crosstalk)

DIMON: Yeah, how to save money, how to buy a home, how to manage a business, if you start a business, how to get a- how to sign a lease, how to negotiate a government contract, so a lot of its education, it's not lending money. So you know, there's a specific account we have is an account where you know, you get a debit card, checking account, all the services, ATM services, branch services, can't overdraft.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You can't overdraft?

DIMON: No, if you buy this account, it does not allow an overdraft. So we have a lot of products and services. we live and learn. And I don't worry about naysayers all the time. You know, we go- we we have a TrueNorth. We know what we're doing. We lift up societies around the world. We do it from low income to high income, we do- we bank governments, we bank the IMF, we bank the World Bank, we bank middle market companies, we make small businesses, we're in lower income neighborhoods. And we want to help- we want to do it all well, and we've done it all well. We're quite comfortable with all the things we do and and that they're also good for shareholders in the long run.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've been doing this particular program since roughly 2020. Put about $18 billion into it.

DIMON: Yup

MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to expand it?

DIMON: Yeah, so we've been doing programs like this for a long time. The biggest lesson to us, and we did this huge effort in Detroit. So Detroit is one of the major American cities that had not had a renaissance. They ended up with a fabulous mayor, Mayor Duggan, we worked with him, we did an extended ten- almost in the 10th year anniversary - $250 million. I won't repeat all the same things, a lot of the similar things here. But working with local nonprofits, local institutions, local government, and it works you know, you can turn a city, you can make it work better, you can- have you go- go to the- go into downtown Detroit and look at it today versus what it was 15 years ago, then you can see the powerful effort. That kind of informed us, you know what, we could do this in other places, in different ways. And so we're always learning, but we now- we have now of doing something like this in 15 cities

MARGARET BRENNAN: Do those states, do those governors and mayors come to you or are you still-

DIMON: They- sometimes. But you know, we we talk we obviously talk to a lot of them, but I think you've heard you know, Peter Scher talk about that the collaboration is what makes it. We're not asking for gifts from cities or states or anything like that. But we also need their help. Like I gave you that very specific example about affordable housing here.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.

DIMON: So that the rules laws are different in Michigan and are different in other places. So if you've got people working together works, if you know if the local government doesn't like business and you know turns the scans and doesn't, you know, thinks we're bad. So no, it's hard to want to do business there and they're making a mistake. What they should do is go to Detroit. Come here. Visit a branch, see what policy works and what policy doesn't work.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So in cities across the country right now, there's a homelessness problem.

DIMON: Yeah.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's some of it is linked to many issues, but one of them is just accessible, and affordable housing. What incentive do you see for a developer right now to go in and try to take a loan and build up that kind of housing, like what is preventing that?

DIMON: we are one of the biggest affordable lending in the in the country and a lot other banks do a lot of great job with that too. It is- first of all it's very local. It could be zoning laws, it could be requirements, it could be building requirements. It could be logo construct- it could be a million different things. But we often provide either the equity or the debt or the mezzanine, to build affordable housing, we do it everywhere. So I can give you- I'd have to send you a big position papers-

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right

DIMON: different by every state. It is a big deal. It can be done, but you really need to have competent, affordable housing policies.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And that comes down as you're saying to these community relationships- (crosstalk)

DIMON: It's community-

MARGARET BRENNAN: that you have to try to solve

DIMON: And community laws, there are community laws, there are city laws, there are federal laws, there- A lot is legal stuff.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, you've been in Washington for a few days, have you talked about this with lawmakers? I mean at the national level (crosstalk)

DIMON: I've talked about the mortgage thing. Oh I've talked a lot of these things all the time. I go to Washington all the time, you know-

MARGARET BRENNAN: But the acute homelessnes-

DIMON: No. That's hard for us to do, we do affordable housing.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yup

DIMON: And, all these other issues are so local, you got to really get into the local level. So our people get involved in that. And, and we get involved in federal policies. But I think one really important thing, this is a microcosm of what a bank does. And you know, and then other businesses, you heard about other businesses coming to lower income neighborhoods and what they're doing. But it's- but the most important thing is also government federal policy, around infrastructure, education, taxation, regulation, health care. So we, you know, we got to tackle these problems from both sides, good public policy at the federal level, good public policy at the state level. And then people like us doing our job, you know, that we're- that we we're meant to do. Finance, grow, develop people's dreams, help them accomplish their goals.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So big picture, because you've lived through a lot of crisis in this country. And just looking back, you were at the helm during the financial crisis and the Great Recession, sovereign debt crisis, the pandemic. This moment we are in feels like a transition point and inflection point. And I wonder how you think about where America is at this moment.

DIMON: Yeah. I think- I mean, I think it's very important people understand, America is the most prosperous nation the world's ever seen. Our basic principles of freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, are unbelievable. The innovation is unparalleled anywhere around the world. So start with that. It's an amazing position of strength. The economy is going through a bunch of things, and you just mentioned them COVID, and stuff like that. And we don't, we don't always really know whether you have a mild recession or hard recession. And if it happens, we're going to be fine. I feel bad, terrible, for people who lose jobs. We want to keep it as short as possible. I do think you're right about a turning point. But that turning point is about geopolitics. That's about Ukraine, oil, Russia, war, migration, food, national security, China trade, that whole bucket of things. And I'd put in that category, quantitative tightening, which is basically reducing the liquidity in the banking system in the world. That that is actually - forget us for a second - that it could be very difficult - high dollar, the dollar going up - higher rates and quantitative tightening on smaller countries around the world

MARGARET BRENNAN: The World Bank and the IMF have been warning about this for a while.

DIMON: Yes. And some say you got to put that whole mix in -what's happening in geopolitics, I would say that that's critical. And Ukraine is a turning point. You know, Ukraine is a turning point where, you know, maybe all this sort of self- illusion that we had that some how the world's at peace, and everything would be fine, that should have been shattered. And therefore we should be thinking about how can America do great in the next 100 years? What policies should we have? Obviously, it's a change. And you know, I hold our military in the highest regard. But what they accomplish around the world is extraordinary. But what do we need, and part is just having a very strong economy, which helps pay for all this, and it has to be done with our allies, otherwise, you're not going to end up with the world that we really want.

MARGARET BRENNAN: When I looked at your last shareholder letter, which I know you take a direct role in writing

DIMON: Word -I write every word.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that was April so-

DIMON: I get help, but I write every word.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You, everyone, everyone goes through a process and thinking through these things, and when you ranked some of the things worrying you, Ukraine was right up there-

DIMON: Yeah

MARGARET BRENNAN: with all the domestic issues. That was right after the war started.

DIMON: Yeah

MARGARET BRENNAN: And now we're at a point where some would look and say, okay, it wasn't the worst case scenario in Europe in terms of severe recession. They're finding ways to get oil and gas elsewhere. Do you think in the same way now, as you did-

DIMON: Absolutely

MARGARET BRENNAN: -then in terms of risk?

DIMON: I think even more so.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Really?

DIMON: That's a false sense of security that you've had this war going on, you know, for nine months or whatever, and that somehow it's okay. Oil prices went way up. Europe's going through a recession. Migration has been extraordinary. You haven't seen the full effect of food prices around the world. If you go to Europe, they- they would - they're taking this much more seriously than Americans are. They're on the front line, you had those missiles going to Poland. You have, basically nuclear blackmail. I mean, it is as serious as you can get. So we should all hope it goes away, that there's some kind of armistice or settlement. You know, that's good for Ukraine, by the way.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

DIMON: But this is, this is the Western world under attack. I mean, this is to take it - anything like that. And wars, if you read the history of wars, they don't start, they don't end the way people think they would when they started.

MARGARET BRENNAN: No

DIMON: So that's like every war. And so the danger of this war is extraordinary. And it can go on for years. But this oil and gas thing, it looks like they're, you know, the Europeans will get through it this winter. But this oil and gas problem is going to go on for years. So I, you know, if I was, you know, in the government or anywhere else, I'd say, I have to prepare for getting much worse. I hope it doesn't. But I would definitely be preparing for it to get much worse.

MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that look like to you in terms of what should be prepared for on the energy front?

DIMON: Well I- I was - so it's multiple things. On the energy front, we need secure, reliable, cheap oil and gas. The problem, you know, a lot of people think that oil and gas prices being high is good for CO2. It's not. So cheap, reliable - you're looking to Germany, I mean, the Europeans are terrified. Their - their energy prices are 2, 3, 4, 5 times ours, which is hurting consumers, which the governments have to do something about, and it's hurting businesses. You know, and, and, and it's just started. And so the pain and suffering could get a lot worse. So, and it has the benefit, lower prices have the benefit of having more production. Okay. They have the benefit of helping poor nations, lower income individuals, our allies who are desperate for more secure energy, and CO2, because quite predictably-

MARGARET BRENNAN: Carbon emissions.

DIMON: Carbon emissions - because quite predictably carbon emissions are going up, because nations rich and poor around the world are turning on -back on their coal plants. They cannot afford expensive energy, and they can't afford no energy. So you know to me - to solve climate, we kind of need all the above, permitting, plants, gas is the best and cleanest way to reduce coal, which is the best way to reduce CO2. So we are really thoughtful policy, confident the policy would get us there. But it also is military policy, economic policy, including trade. So when I say economic, I'm talking about you know trade is one thing, but economic is investment rights. So anything that relates to national security will have to be changed - like you know about semiconductor, rare earths -

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to ask you all about that. Yeah.

JAMIE DIMON: And OK so that'll if you ask me later, I'll wait. But those are all things that have to be fixed.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's button up on economy - on energy, though, because, you know, President Biden has called it Putin - Putin's price spike. But he's also blamed price inflation on corporate profits. And I know this irritates you.

DIMON: Yeah

MARGARET BRENNAN: You've argued energy costs are not high because of price gouging, but because of the dramatic decline in investments in energy, which results in reduced supply when demand goes up. So if that's true, what is it going to take to increase lending to companies so they can make those investments?

DIMON: Yeah

MARGARET BRENNAN: is that the choke point?

DIMON: Yeah, this is it's a little more complicated now because part of it is that companies don't want to do it.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?

DIMON: Well, part, part of that, but when people talk about excise profit tax. That's one, they can't get permits done, they can't get leasing and stuff like that. And part of is their investors are putting a lot of pressure on them, you know, that -

MARGARET BRENNAN: To go green?

DIMON: To go green, but not to invest too much capital, where you're not making a profit with oil at a high price. You know, it's not enough. Like that. And so, so it is that so there are think of- It's a global problem, America produces 10 million barrels a day, the world consumes 100 million. And so, and the other thing we have to remember about oil, which is really important, that it goes up and down for a million different reasons. And people tend to look at one reason and say that's it. But right now, it's come down considerably, mostly because China's slowdown, and Europe's going into recession. And then people think there might be a world recession. So the future price of oil is going down. Those things will reverse. And this underinvestment in oil and gas it will hurt you two or three years out. It's quite predictable, but it's not today. And so we have time, you know, I'm hoping the administration, you know, they're looking at all these issues. I've spoken to John Podesta who now runs the the IRA act about what we can do to accelerate, reduce CO2, but have better, cheaper, more secure energy, not just for us, but for particular allies around the world.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So America set for record oil production in 2023. But it's like the refinery capacity turning into something usable, where that's kind of a choke point. So is the administration making it difficult for that specific kind of investment?

DIMON: I think you'd have to talk to the oil, the oil folks about that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.

DIMON: Look, this world is really complex. I mean, if you don't have the pipelines, you can't have the refinery. If you can't do this, you can't do that. If you don't have the charging stations, you can't do this. If you build EV cars, but it's still coal, coal powered electricity, you're not accomplishing CO2. So I think I just think, We need to really look at this in detail. And hopefully a lot of smart people working on it. I think it's important. We are spending a lot of time on it, because of how critical energy is to the world. And remember, it's 40% of food prices, too. So, so this is not a simple matter. And it's, you know, for food prices, the question is starvation.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right

DIMON: So this isn't a question of how far you can drive your car, how much your gas costs? So I put this whole, I think we need to call a Marshall Plan for energy, you know, and that's got to be all the above, and all the people involved.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But the IRA, you refer to the Inflation Reduction Act, that's just a sliver of what you're imagining for a Marshall Plan of Energy.

DIMON: And that is, that is a huge I mean, we're still studying every piece of it for renewables and EVs and a lot of different things. But it's not just that. It's the infrastructure we're building. It's- it's competition around the world, it's access to rare earths. I mean, when you dig into it as a really complex thing.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are the ingredients needed for electric vehicles-

DIMON: Exactly

MARGARET BRENNAN: that China has a monopoly on right now,

DIMON: They have a monopoly in production, not on where it is. So we have rare earths in America

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right

DIMON: whether we can produce them here or not, because of certain laws and requirements, that's a different issue. We need to build grids, you know, we don't get permissions to- permits to build- build grids. So, you know, one of the deals that was done between the president and Joe Manchin was the permitting bill, that permitting bill is for pipelines, we need to get gas to Louisiana, to get that get Louisiana gas to Europe to help our allies and reduce the costs there. That also reduces their coal usage. So it's very green, if you look at on the margin. And so it gets- it gets very complicated, and we just need to do the work.

MARGARET BRENNAN: How would you- I mean, I remember covering financial crisis and all this and the frustration between Wall Street and Washington that they just kind of spoke past each other all the time. Where do you put that conversation now? Are people here hearing what you're trying to explain in terms of market dynamics and investment?

DIMON: So I think it's sometimes justifiable when people talk across each other because damage was done, there was damage done in the financial crisis, not all the big banks would have failed. And not everyone is equally guilty and all that, but, and then, of course, things, people have simple political slogans-

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right

DIMON: that you know, get elected or something. But I think there's a lot of talk, we talk all the time to the Biden administration and multiple levels. And we should, you know, I'm going to help any president to try to do the best job for America. And those conversations are pretty intense. So Peter talks to them, I talked to them, they come to the BRT, which you saw a part of. And so it's very important, we do it. And you will be you're not always going to get your way. And there's going to be disagreements, but that's okay, too.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. And I know you speak, you speak plainly, which you are known for doing. I want to ask you about China. It looks like they are loosening some of their COVID restrictions, maybe moving away from COVID Zero. How do you see this impacting in the long and short term?

DIMON: So my own view, and again, they they kind of have to do that. You see the political unrest, and you also see the damage doing to their economy. So they may - they announced like yesterday - ten different things. It sounds good- I just read them quick this morning. They sound good to me. I think they want to get their economy going. Again, that's a function of capital, COVID, laws, trade and things like that. And they've just started to have real conversations, or they said they're going to with the Biden administration. The most important thing about China in America, we actually talk that we actually get engaged at a detailed level of what we agree where we disagree, and try to resolve these things and also work on some of the things we got to do together climate, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, bioterrorism, and it's in all our interests to fix those problems. And you can't do without America in China.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not just the second largest economy in the world. Our countries are incredibly intertwined.

DIMON: They're incredibly intertwined. But you, what you really need is American leadership to do this. And to bring our allies in. If we do adjust bilaterally, it will not work, if we- because the Chinese will go negotiate separate better deals with you know, God knows how many different countries so we need to do it kind of in combination with allies.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So the US and China are in direct competition and the chances of conflict are arising on the national security front. The former Goldman Sachs CEO and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. I know you know him, has warned the two economies are just too intertwined to separate at this point. How do you think about that, and the increased conversation about trying to find separate supply chains and weaning ourselves off of, of cheap Chinese manufacturing.

DIMON: So number one, I'm a patriot. And national security is paramount, absolutely national security, American national security, I'm going to leave Taiwan aside, I'll leave that to the experts and that kind of thing. And then most importantly, for the American public, we have the most prosperous kind of the world's ever seen. If we open our doors to people, millions, billions of people come here, we have the best innovation, we've got food, water and energy, we're in extraordinary good shape. And we shouldn't be shy about that or afraid or panicked or anything like that.

DIMON: What we need is tough negotiations. And you've already missed on national security, that's going to be about semiconductors, rare earth, penicillins. You know, that's, that's a unilateral. The Chinese do that, we do it. Most businesses support it, that gets very complicated into an export controls and investment controls. But basically, the government's working with people like us, a lot of other companies- but how do you implement something like that, that's that that is good for national security, but doesn't diminish American business doing well overseas.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.

DIMON: Because it could do that. And again, it gets very specific. The other two trade things are not as important okay. One is, you know, every company wants to have a reliable, secure line, you know, supply chain, some people already moving their stuff, you can move some stuff to Mexico, you can move it to India, etc. So that's already taking place. And then the third one is called is how we all look at competition, unfair competition, state controlled competition. And again, that also needs to be done with allies. Because, you know, if I was just all around Latin America, and they say to me, Hey, you know, we actually love America. But China's here with money, technology, they're making a cheaper, and what's my alternative, Americans got to have alternatives. Some of that will turn out to be that we need better development, finance, better diplomacy, we need better rules around how banks or companies could go down and invest in foreign countries to do things that make sense. So it's comprehensive, the government's fully aware of it, it's doable, it's going to take work and take time.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But, you're just saying the State Department and those other sort of softer bits of diplomacy need to be beefed up.

DIMON: Immediately.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Immediately.

DIMON: Immediately, and diplomacy, I say development finance–

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

DIMON: Because, you know, if the Chinese are gonna go there and build a bridge or build a plant or buy the lithium mine. And you're gonna have American companies who would, could but don't for a whole bunch of different reasons, you should ask the question why. And I don't want to go through all the different reasons. But there are reasons American companies don't go to certain countries. And so we- It could all be done. And I think, you know, we're rolling up our sleeves. It should never have gotten this far, it did. I don't want to cry over spilled milk. But, and the other thing too, remember is, America could do a lot of things unilaterally. You know–

MARGARET BRENNAN: Like what?

DIMON: Well, if we don't- if we don't think they're being fair on X, you know, we- think of it as trade. If I can't sell there, you can sell here, if I can't invest in 100% [unintelligible] you can't invest in 100% there. There's a reciprocal behavior–

MARGARET BRENNAN: So does tariffs stay on?

DIMON: You know, I look, I think, I think it was the right thing to focus on China years ago. I think that was the wrong way to go about it. But they're not going to come down until it's negotiated as part of something else. Don't (crosstalk), maybe areas which should come down right away, just to help certain producers and certain consumers.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You referenced some of the domestic–

DIMON: We like we have to go back to like TPP, we have to stop thinking about trade–

MARGARET BRENNAN: free trade within Asia–

DIMON: Negotiated trade. I mean, obviously, we shouldn't sign the deal that's not in the interest United States of America. But think of it–

MARGARET BRENNAN: But no one is going back to TPP.

DIMON: No, but we're making a mistake–

MARGARET BRENNAN: –it was politically toxic.

DIMON: I know. But I don't know what that means. Because we have a trade policy with Asia, it's functioning today, make it better. The notion that says we're not gonna have a trade deal is a mistake, because we have one today, that one would have been better. And we just got to change how we- and there's also strategic- in this case it's also geopolitically strategic. Think of real politic here, this would have been better, an American and Asia trading system that is set up the right way that we think has the right rules, requirements, laws, governance, etc. And then China could be invited in. It's not against China.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when you talk about and you reference their investment in semiconductors, here, electric vehicles, that kind of thing, that's part of the Biden administration's domestic economic revitalization, but it is national security policy as well.

DIMON: Yeah, it's a little both, we kind of mixed them up, mix-and-match them a little bit.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. But there are some critics who say that that's causing a little bit of market distortion there.

DIMON: It does, I think, look, you know, this stuff gets complicated and remember it gets written by Congress and–

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.

DIMON: –so the body is pretty good. But it has really irritated the Europeans, because it's buy America build America, it's a huge disadvantage for you know, a part of the world we need really very good relations with. When when people complain, the first thing you always do is to say, 'were they right?' And they're right about some of it, not all of it. And you know, the President did say we can tweak and modify it and–

MARGARET BRENNAN: The electric vehicles and things like that–

DIMON: –and I think that can be done. But here's the really important part of this. It's not just that. If Europe goes its own way and trade and they said they're gonna do their own IRA bill. Either their own trade bloc buy America- buy Europe build Europe, that is very bad for the global negotiates of trade. That is very bad for national security. That is very bad for the next century of America. And that's why I think this - is a it doesn't sound like it is. But it's absolutely critical for national security, we get this one, right.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm not at all disagreeing with you. I want to ask you, though about like, the way foreign policy is exercised right now. With Russia, for example, it was financial warfare at first. Yeah, that's the direct hit the United States is taking on Russia. And I wonder how you think that was handled?

DIMON: I thought it was handled extremely well, actually, I think there have been occasions where we overdid our financial sanctions and using it because you don't want to say I don't want to do business with American banks, or American entities or stuff like that. It has been a little misuse, but there are times it's properly used. So here's both the Europeans and the American authorities, you know, the Treasury Department here, who said, this is a way to part of our big geopolitical war, helping Ukraine. And they were right. And it was both sanctions and export controls and things like that. And I think they did it the right way. There's constant communication. I mean, if I say commun- like every day about how you effectuate these things, and which ones work and which ones don't work, and how Swift was going to work, and all these various things, but But it's been quite good. I think they were very much right to do it in this case.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But you couldn't do this with China, could you because the economies are too intertwined.

DIMON: You couldn't well, you if you had to you could, but that would, that's a whole, the economic effect in China and the world would be dramatically worse, no one would benefit from that. And by whatever it is, it'd probably be worse for China than for us. Because like I said, we have all the food, water and energy we need. We have peace in North America here. China, the American public may not know, China imports 11 million barrels of oil a day. They're not sitting there saying how comfortable they are. They're sitting there saying how vulnerable they might be. So you got to, if you're going to look at China, look at the whole thing. Take a deep breath, and figure out what's in our interests and then go negotiate. And like I said, a lot of it can be done unilaterally, it has to be done multilaterally, like with our allies.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You had said in this country, you were happy about the midterm results. I mean, the old adage was like gridlock is good for Wall Street. But when you're talking about very large challenges to the country, that are left unaddressed, that seems to be a risk.

DIMON: I didn't. I didn't say anything about gridlock.

MARGARET BRENNAN: No, I'm saying that.

DIMON: (Crosstalk) I thought it–

MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that what we're going to get with a split Congress–

JAMIE DIMON: –I thought the election was good. Because on both parties the kind of the- the wing nuts didn't get elected. And there, so the rational thing, when I was just in Congress, I was gratified by their thought they want to make progress. And I think they can make progress. There are a lot of examples in history, under George W. Bush, Obama, Clinton, where when he had divided Congress actually got a lot of good things done–

(Crosstalk)

MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've got really thin margins–

JAMIE DIMON: –and I would prefer to see collaboration and getting good stuff done. And so I think–

MARGARET BRENNAN: You're staying optimistic about that.

DIMON: Yeah, I think there's a good chance they will get some good things done.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So so we're days away from this government funding deadline. And Congress is gonna have to pass the bill to avoid a shutdown. As a risk manager, where do you put the risk level here?

DIMON: Well funding is different than debt ceiling.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I know.

DIMON: Okay.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But the risk is once power shifts come January that it could become a bigger problem.

DIMON: (Crosstalk) Yeah, I would say government funding is not the way to–

MARGARET BRENNAN: Could be used as leverage.

DIMON: It's not the way to run a railroad. I mean, basically you end up spending much more money too because the American public may not know, you pay people and the you pay them more to come back to work. It costs us much more money. So even if you want to be fiscally responsible is not a good idea. The debt ceiling is, you talk about, June of next year, and we'll deal with that later.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, there's some debate about whether it should be done now in these last few weeks while Democrats still have control to avoid that kind of showdown.

DIMON: As they should because the catastrophic effects of an- of an actual default, not the debates I understand both sides why we want it, how they want to use it is, that's catastrophic, or potentially catastrophic. I would never take that risk. So for me, yes, I'd get it done now. Take- take it off the table.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So you said back in 2019, on CNBC, my heart is Democratic, but my brain is kind of Republican. The world's changed a lot since 2019. I wonder what what you are thinking right now.

DIMON: I'm kind of in the same place. And I look, I think we are our brother's keeper, we take care of ourselves. We do community branches, and I want my employees to feel great, and I want customers to be happy. And I just think we need rational policy, you know, really rational policy and that a lot of that policy is not Democrat or Republican. Getting proper infrastructure built is not Democrat or Republican. We should all acknowledge that inner city schools don't work particularly well, in a lot of areas. Half the kids don't graduate. That's not Democrat or Republican. That's acknowledging the problem. And then talking about solutions. Health care, we have the best in the world. Hell, I'm a beneficiary of it. But we also have some of the worst. Trust- almost 20% of GDP, 50 million people uninsured, huge obesity, high blood pressure, things- a lot of things which are fixable, and I can go on and on and we need good policy. You know, good. And no policy is sometimes bad policy.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You referenced, you're the beneficiary of the health system. You had this near death experience.

DIMON: Yep.

MARGARET BRENNAN: How has that changed how you view your work right now? And I wonder if it's changed whether you have any desire to enter government.

DIMON: Now I'm- I don't play golf. You know, it's I basically, I still love what I do. I love helping people. I love the people here. I have, I'm so proud of them sometimes. And so that hasn't changed my view, I'm I want to do things. I'm always going to do something. I'm not going to go smell the flowers and stuff like that. I'm not sure sure. I'm suited for government. I want to help my country. I'll do anything I can help my country.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And it sounds like you've got a lot of ideas to do that.

DIMON: And we have a lot of ideas."

JIM CRAMER: Scotty, thank you for teeing me off. This is exactly what we want to start talking about which is serving the underserved, getting people in Philadelphia here at 52nd Street to have ownership. I saw you happier than I've ever seen you. You are a banker, a local banker at heart.

JAMIE DIMON: Exactly. People always think of us as big CEOs in corporate headquarters we do a lot of corporate business but the end of the day, we have branches and human beings that are run by human beings that you saw. They love their clients in that community branch we're doing mortgages for low-income individuals. We're doing small business advice, we bring in the whole community. It's a fabulous concept that we've just really enjoyed doing it.

CRAMER: And this is replicable. You are doing it in another city, tough city like Baltimore.

DIMON: We have 15. I've been to like 12 of them so far. We also have 100 community managers so one of the special things here is we have a branch manager and a community manager who walks the street, meets some local businesses, the not to profits, the enterprise who is here works with the local institutions, brings them in. We have we've had 60 events there to educate the local population about small business, getting a mortgage, saving money, things like that. So they've been a huge success, and we're just really proud of them. Oh and they're hell of a lot of fun to go do.

CRAMER: Well, the cynics would say you're just doing this because of political you're doing it because you want to look good in Washington. That's that when I saw I saw guys actually bankers gonna make money off the neighborhood because the neighborhood is going to do well.

DIMON: The cynics are terrible. They're always—

CRAMER: They are terrible.

DIMON: We serve people. We serve people every day that that branch is so we want every branch manager walking in like that. You saw the story about the one person who got the mortgage and lived there for 25 years.

CRAMER: Dynamite.

DIMON: And the woman's whose name I don't remember the mortgage loan officer who called him every day to get him through the process, how proud he is to own a home now. And he was telling his son that we own this home. So you know that yeah, that moves. It's one person but that bends the curve right there.

CRAMER: Okay so when we hear that the mortgage business is tough, like Wells Fargo has laid off a lot of people. I didn't see any of that today. I saw on a micro level, not what the what the Federal Reserve's doing, not what the Fed's fund rate is, but about what happens when you revitalize the neighborhood and you get an uplift in business in the whole town.

DIMON: That's correct. There's good evidence both anecdotal and we have some numbers to support that when you have a branch there that you have local businesses move in you have a home be sold that changes the value of things around around the area. We've done this now in DC, in Harlem and in Crenshaw, LA. Yeah, so these can these things can lift up the whole society. And the other thing which you may remember, we hire locally, the art is done locally, and if we bring in food, it's local vendors. It was the place was reconstructed by a black construction company. So we and we, everything we do, we try to do local and it's really a community branch and with local outreach, and they've been great.

CRAMER: So how do you join the real banker you are, community real banker with something like oh my god, we're gonna have recessions so therefore, we're in trouble, a Federal Reserve this, Fed rates Fed funds rate that. These don't seem to work together. Are there two economies the economy that we obsess about, and the economy that is creating a great wealth in this area?

DIMON: Yeah, I mean, I basically run the company. I know that there's the economy can go up or down. We don't run it that way. We do it this way. We build branches. We hire people, we train people, we build technology, and we basically do it through thick or thin. And even even more than that, I want to be helping this community regardless of the environment. We will be there for clients regardless of the environment. Yes, we all talk about the economy, you guess about it, but we manage through it, and we try to make sure we can handle whatever it throws at us which is often different than you expect.

CRAMER: But a $3 trillion base here, which is just incredible, largest in the world. So I know you have to worry about recession, over the big panoply that you have. Do you tell people listen, batten down?

DIMON: I tell people not really. Yes, uncertain things. But for the most part, no, but we always have a recession playbook where you might do a certain credit—

CRAMER: Well, are you breaking it out right here?

DIMON: Say it again?

CRAMER: Are you breaking out the recession playbook right now.

DIMON: Not really. Right now the U.S. economy, this is the contradiction here.

CRAMER: Okay.

DIMON: The U.S. economy right now is doing quite well. Consumers have a lot of money. They're spending it, jobs are plentiful. I think it's fabulous by the way that wages are going up for the low end. So I get a lot of complaints from CEOs about this—

CRAMER: But that's inflationary.

DIMON: But they haven't had a pay raise for 20 years. And so you know, here our minimum wage is something like the 40th percentile of all Americans and they get mental, dental and medical and things like that. But it's wonderful. That's, that's today. Out in front of us, there's some scary stuff and you and I know there's always uncertainty. That's that's a normal thing. This uncertainty is a little bit more than that.

CRAMER: When you think about this, for a long time, we say well, the Fed's behind the curve, now we say they're ahead of the curve, maybe they're gonna hurt us. I'm not hearing that we should obsess, maybe we are obsessing about every quarter point. Because you've been there when it's 7,8. You've been there when it's 10. You've been there when it's 13. You still did your business.

DIMON: Yeah, we will be fine regardless of the interest rates out there and we prepare, and we're prepared to handle the fat tails, not the ones you expect the ones you don't expect because you want that from me. You want JPMorgan Chase to be a strong entity regardless of the environment. And like I said, I want to serve the client regardless of the environment so I think look, the Fed will do what it has to do it's kind of caught up. They're gonna pause we all know that for a while they should. It may not be enough and so I think—

CRAMER: But the 2% inflation, are you there for that?

DIMON: I think it'll take a while. I just don't think it will come down enough—

CRAMER: So rates longer, higher and longer.

DIMON: Possibly.

CRAMER: Okay well you know that hurts, will that hurt lending, will it hurt what you're trying to accomplish in 52nd Street in Philadelphia?

DIMON: All things being, it wouldn't do anything with we are doing here. It won't change our plans at all. All things being equal might be slightly worse than the economy. Still there's still a chance for a soft landing. I mean, I wouldn't take if off the list of possibilities.

CRAMER: Okay now across the street from this bank is a check, check cashing. We know that they're also AI lending, we know there's buy now, pay later. There's a lot of people trying to reinvent things. Maybe it's phony tech, bank versus what I know you might think of as phony tech. Where are you?

DIMON: It's not I mean, AI is real like we use we already use AI, machine learning natural language processing in 300 cases. And we do it to reduce risk, fraud, marketing. When we move money around the world, it's run through OFAC systems, sanction systems, risk systems. It also uses AI to make sure is this abnormal, is it a bad pattern? We use voice recognition we have tons of things to stop the—

CRAMER: Well, it's not you. Remember what Jensen Huang said from NVIDIA, hey, you're doing I know you're doing machine learning logic and it's working for you.

DIMON: That's correct. But, but I would say to everyone out there it is still at the early stages. This is this is this is real. This is a dramatic change and people just get really geared up for how you can use AI for good. Remember it can be used for bad so there's a little bit of an arms race, and the bad guy is going to use it too and you just have to keep that in mind.

CRAMER: Alright, so I mean, look, it's in the news today. You guys issued JPMorgan. This was the same thing when I was a homicide reporter used to spring on people. It's very, it's my, I'm going back for 40 years. JPMorgan admits Jes Staley had inappropriate contact with Jeffrey Epstein. It's you guys saying this. How come the AI doesn't catch stuff like that?

DIMON: Probably would have. But I think I think basically, I can't talk about the specific litigation.

CRAMER: Right. Is this the end of it?

DIMON: It's just we have an extraordinary amount of risk, legal, control people, a lot of them come out of the DOJ, the Attorney Generals who know what they're doing who have to make judgment calls and hopefully, hopefully make the good ones.

CRAMER: Okay, so let's talk about what I need you to talk about what is I have to regard as the banker I saw today versus the things I read from you. And I say that because sometimes I lose hope when I hear you. And then sometimes like this morning when I see you smile, see you congratulate people talk about even in somewhat expletive deleted way how exciting it is. How do you, I'm having trouble Jamie with the one that is saying listen, there's a lot of gloom you gotta get together with the one that says there's a lot of good things happening.

DIMON: They're both a little true. I love seeing our people and seeing our clients getting out in the road and you learn something every day. I heard of the woman who made that mortgage. I mean literally, it just it warms my heart and so it's about just put this in perspective, economy is good today. There's always uncertainty but it's heightened now. It's heightened because of QT, Russia, Ukraine, oil, gas, more migration, trade, China, and that's a rational thing, but then put out here what I really feel, America is the most prosperous nation on the planet. We have all the food and energy we need. We have enormous innovation. We're gonna get through everything.

CRAMER: Called in January for a Marshall Plan for food and energy. Why do we need a Marshall Plan when we got what we need.

DIMON: For the world because—

CRAMER: You said America always has to be put first.

DIMON: Yes, but I think America first America has to help if you don't have American leadership around the world I mean, mature, polite, diplomatic, it can't be our way the highway. If you don't have it, you're gonna have chaos. The only the only one who can lead is America. I'm not saying that because I'm being arrogant—

CRAMER: No.

DIMON: It's the military, economic and capabilities that and so—

CRAMER: But at the same time in the same breath, you said in your January piece, don't forget FDR and Churchill made common cause with Stalin one of the worst detailing years of our lifetime to defeat Hitler. At the same point, you talk about maybe we need to have allies that common cause allies just on this issue. I read your piece of saying maybe we got to go to China and defeat Putin together.

DIMON: I don't think we can do that.

CRAMER: Why not?

DIMON: I think the real point is American leadership, real politic, this is not worrying about not real, real politic, which is my reference to Stalin and that we've got to make sure our allies are safe, and that they want to trade with us and they want to ally with us and stuff like that, which is diplomatic, but oil and gas. You see what it could have done to Europe. It's already hurting a lot of poor nations, it's hurting poor people, governments have to basically subsidize it even more. So I'm trying to make the point is that if we don't get affordable, reasonable, secure energy, it will be bad for the world and by the way, is gonna be bad for CO2 because you see countries around the world turning back on their coal plants. So I'm making the argument we need a comprehensive strategy to make sure we get through this and make the world safe for democracy for the next 100 years.

CRAMER: Alright, so let's just go back to what the juxtaposition. I saw people today who are going to be empowered, the neighborhood, I know that there's a 50% lift. We went to 9 and 19th which is an even tougher area so to speak going back a few years ago. I look at all this and then I think about okay, so I need to worry about Jay Powell and you worry about the Fed. There's something wrong here. There's something wrong because maybe that's too short a term. Maybe what we're thinking about when we talk we're talking about the Fed is not what is happening boots on the ground here.

DIMON: Yeah, I think they're different. I mean, the Fed look, I have all the respect for Jay Powell. But the fact is, we lost a little bit of control of inflation, models didn't pick that up. I've always been suspicious of models, and when using them extensively, I would say use a little bit of judgment too. And there's been a seat change. Governments have borrowing a lot of money and you got to incorporate that what's taken place that means they're spending it that's inflationary. Wages, we haven't, we've seen come down but not so much. Oil and gas will probably be going up because, you know, the investment has been curtailed. And, you know, the green environment, green economy, close to $4 trillion a year of additional spending. So you talk and the IRA Act, which I think has a lot of good stuff in it. The Infrastructure Act, this is huge money. And so you know me, you've got to see change. And I think we shall get adjusted to that. And yeah, we'll have more normalization interest rates, and we'll be fine. Just remember America's the most prosperous place on the planet. We'll be fine.

CRAMER: Okay, but I don't I know that area very well. My family's been here for 175 years. That area has not had vibrancy for 65 years. Are you telling me that government did anything to that area? We talked about the government this government that, the government did nothing for that area. That's why that area is so under banked and the people are poor and they shouldn't be. JPMorgan is more important than the government when it comes to that area. Why talk about the government so much? You're the business, business is the greatest source for social change.

DIMON: I totally agree. But we need good government policy and we got to do it in collaboration. So we're doing a lot of collaboration there. The mayor was there.

CRAMER: Yes, it was great.

DIMON: You need zoning laws changed, you need inner city schools to teach kids—

CRAMER: And your people will do that? Your branch will do that?

DIMON: We try to do all of that, we try to get kids jobs we got rid of, we're hiring ex-felons now we're we got rid of college degree required were necessary, but we need government to do to change the mortgage laws to make them more affordable to people. We need government to do a better job in inner city school education. We need government do a better job with the zoning laws about for affordable housing. So in collaboration, you can lift up that neighborhood, and you're absolutely correct. A lot of government rules regulation requires, they completely backfire. They have the total adverse consequences to what they were intended to do, but they don't change them. So we need government to be a little more reactive.

CRAMER: We do need government. Now we're talking to Jamie Dimon, Chairman & CEO of JPMorgan Chase. I'm so glad that Scott Wapner gave us a chance. We are going to be back with you later on ""Mad Money."" Thank you so much.

DIMON: You're very welcome."

TRANSCRIPT: CNN Anchor Poppy Harlow’s exclusive interview with JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon

POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Hi, Jamie.

JAMIE DIMON, CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.: How are you doing?

HARLOW: I’m great. Thank you.

DIMON: Good.

HARLOW: You know, this is home for us. This is — Atlanta’s home — I mean, this is CNN’s home, I should say.

DIMON: I know that.

HARLOW: So we’re happy to be here. Thanks very much.

DIMON: Well, I’m thrilled to be here too. Thank you for having me.

HARLOW: You know, we — just to witness that out there was pretty remarkable. And to hear what you said to this community of Summerhill — you said, one mortgage, you can lift up a society.

DIMON: Yeah.

HARLOW: This is the community center branch here, but you have a lot of them. You opened the first one in Harlem in New York City in 2019. You’ve got 16 cities, now Atlanta. Why’d you do this?

DIMON: Yeah. This is a great idea someone had, it wasn’t mine, for a community branch. So it’s bigger, it’s a community space. It’s built by local contractors — think of minority contractors, local food, local art. The artists — you know, people put the art up.

When we — we hire locally, we have what we call our community managers. So, you have a branch manager, traditional. But the community manager gets to know all the local businesses, not-for-profits, religious institutions. We invite people in to learn about mortgages, and saving money, and starting a business. And it’s been unbelievable.

And I’ve been to like 14 of the 16, or so. We’ve also taken the community manager — we now have 120. That’s worked so well. We’re putting them in a lot of different communities.

So you know, it’s just part of what we try to do to — when we enter a town, we have 30 percent of our branches or so in lower-income neighborhoods. And we just try to lift up the neighborhoods and bring in all the things that JPMorgan Chase can do to help.

HARLOW: One of the things you say though, because this is part of the $30 billion commitment to black and brown communities across the country, but you — your — you explicitly say this isn’t charity.

DIMON: Yeah.

HARLOW: There’s a strong business case.

DIMON: Yeah, that’s totally true. And there’s two things. So those are huge numbers that we say, you know, 12 billion of affordable housing, 8 billion of mortgages. But at the end of the day, it takes a local — a local place.

The mortgage and loan officer are reaching out to people, helping them through the progress. Getting them a homeowner’s grant if they need something like that. So that’s how it takes place.

But when you do it, you know, we’re right across from Georgia State University. There are businesses opening up around here partially because you have a branch in here. And it lifts up the community, but it’s also good business. And you want good business.

As these businesses come here, they are — they’re hiring locally. There are paychecks in the neighborhood, and it lifts up everybody. So that’s part of the — a job of a bank.

HARLOW: What’s interesting, though, about this time, exactly this moment that we’re sitting down is we’re in a rising interest rate environment and it’s just harder folks to get mortgages. You’ve lamented that reality, especially for lower-income individuals in this country right now.

Do you think, given the high prices of homes now, the rising interest rate environment, this American dream of owning a home is really no longer for a lot of folks?

DIMON: I think we have to bring it back. You know, if you look at homes, they’re — for most people, they’re the way to start building family net-worth and family wealth. And there are a lot of things to do. So you already see home prices down in some places. Builders are already making concessions. We do a lot of special things, you know, a special purpose credit for — sometimes in low-income neighborhoods.

I think the government can do a lot of things. I’ve — you know, we talk about these things here, but the government can do a lot of things to reduce the cost of mortgage —

HARLOW: Better than they’re doing now?

DIMON: Absolutely.

HARLOW: What?

DIMON: Reducing production costs, servicing costs, origination costs, securitization costs, which would make the cost of a small mortgage probably 50 to 75 basis points cheaper. That alone would —

HARLOW: That’s a lot of money a month.

DIMON: That’s a lot of money a month and it’d make it available to more people. So — and we try to take policies — you know, things we can do here, but also worry about what Washington would do to make it easier with commerce controls —

HARLOW: Are they listening to you?

DIMON: I’ve been begging them at this point for a long time. I’m praying, I’m begging, I hope they’ll listen to this. It’s so important and it’s — the other important thing is we’re not doing it for JPMorgan. It won’t affect the future of JPMorgan if we make mortgages more available to lower-income folks around America.

It’s so important for lower-income America. And so we won’t stop pushing this one until we get it done.

HARLOW: You know, you’ve been outspoken and critical of some — much of public policy and in the mortgage space and that’s a big reason why you guys are here. Can you just speak to the inability to build real generational wealth if you can’t get that first start, if you can’t get that first mortgage?

DIMON: Yeah, I think it’s — I think you have to start even before that. It’s skills — it’s inner-city schools. So we do a lot of inner-city schools to get them skills. So you graduate even at 12 years old, with a cyber degree or a data degree or a sales degree of financial management, there are jobs out there that kids need training. And a lot of inner cities don’t do a good — good job at that.

There’s community colleges. You know there’s things like getting higher wages, like I think we should double the earned income tax credit. And then there is —

(CROSSTALK)

HARLOW: You and Warren Buffet have been saying that for years —

DIMON: Absolutely. So the American public, if you — if someone’s — if a single parent is with two kids is making $14,000 a year, the government gives you six, roughly. If — if you’re — don’t have children, they give you about $600.

My view is we need to get more income into neighborhoods. So if you — if you kind of add to that earned income tax credit, I would get rid of the child —

HARLOW: Requirement.

DIMON: — requirement. You get more money in neighborhoods and that money will be well spent. It will lift up those communities. It would be nothing like that. And then you got to remember, jobs bring dignity, jobs bring better social outcomes, you know jobs — that first job — because sometimes people make fun of the burger flipper job, very well from that bigger flipper own — ends up owning the restaurant.

HARLOW: I’ve done it.

DIMON: Exactly, we’ve all done it. And that first job, that first rung in the ladder —

HARLOW: Have you done it?

DIMON: No, but I served in a restaurant, yes. I didn’t — I didn’t flip the burgers.

(CROSSTALK)

HARLOW: Yes, I learned so much being a waitress. Yes.

DIMON: Yes, exactly.

HARLOW: I learned so much. So —

DIMON: And the mortgage is a part of that. So just getting people to open an account, we’ve got, you know, accounts you can open here and start saving money thinking about it. And a lot of us had the benefit that our mom or dad took us to a branch and we started the first passbook —

HARLOW: Yes, I remember that.

DIMON: And then you see your money go from like $84.75 to $85.17. It’s like, that was magic. There’s a God. It’s like the interest. And so people learn and we want that to take place here. You know we don’t want people to be afraid to walk into a branch here. You know come as you are, bring your kids, learn what you’re doing. That’s the community manager is so important because a lot of people, you know, look at a bank and they’re going to walk by.

They’re — it’s not what they’re comfortable with and we want this community to be very comfortable walking in here.

HARLOW: So I just read your annual letter that just came out this week and let’s dive into the banking crisis because you write a lot about it in there. You have been the Wall Street CEO, Jamie, at the middle of trying to steady this banking crisis. You’re the one that Janet Yellen at Treasury has been calling. You’ve been meeting with these folks all weekend long for the past month or so trying to get a handle on this.

Is the current banking crisis over?

DIMON: First, I want to say all the bank CEO’s did it. So I may have been the first phone call but everyone was on every call, talking about ideas and what works. And they’re all patriots and want to help, you know, save the system and make it work better and also to help the regional banks and the community banks. So the people think the big banks benefited because deposits came. Well deposits came. It’s not what anyone wanted. This is not good for the banking system because we want the American public to have trust in all the banks and we also completely acknowledge that community banks can do things we can’t.

And so, we try to support the system and so we all came together. I — I — this is not 2008. OK? This is a much more limited — there are only a handful of banks that had this particular problem. They’ll eventually be resolved one way or another and I think then people should take a deep breath.

In a week or two, a lot of these banks are going to be reporting earnings. I think they’ll probably be pretty good. The Federal Reserve made some, you know, bold, dramatic moves to help it — easier for some of the issues they had. And I’m hoping it will resolve, you know, rather shortly.

HARLOW: You’re hoping?

DIMON: But — hoping, yes.

HARLOW: But is the crisis over? You wrote in your letter, there will be repercussions for years to come.

DIMON: Well, that’s different. I think those repercussions are regulatory. I think — and, you know, I acknowledge, obviously when you have a problem, things need to change. But you know, I’m begging the regulators, just take a deep breath. There are hundreds of rules.

You know, you have to be very careful. What do you want in the banking system? What do you want out? How do you make it easier for community banks and regional banks? How do you reduce their costs, not increase their costs, on the — but also make it safe?

So, if there are problems with held-to-maturity portfolios or uninsured deposits, let’s fix them. Let’s fix them thoughtfully. It’s the mix of all the things we do. It’s not whether you do one thing right or wrong, so.

HARLOW: Do you expect more banks to fail this year?

DIMON: I don’t know. But if there are, I know, honestly, they’ll be resolved, and it will probably be the last of them.

I think — I think we’re getting near the end of this particular crisis. And fewer financial institutions — remember, in ’08, it was hundreds of institutions around the world, far too much leverage; we don’t have that. Huge problems in mortgage markets; we don’t have that. This is nothing like that. And the American public shouldn’t think that.

This will resolve and then we should go look at, you know, what went wrong and fix it, you know, in the clean — in the light of day.

HARLOW: Well, so then what — what was it? If this coming to an end is this is a situation like — you know, Warren Buffett famously said, “only when the tide goes out do you learn who’s been swimming naked.”

DIMON: Yes.

HARLOW: Were these banks swimming naked?

DIMON: Yes, so I said it was hiding in plain sight. Everyone knew about uninsured deposits, everyone knew about interest rate exposure, everyone knew about held-to-maturity portfolios. The only difference — the only real difference was what we called concentrated clients.

So, Silicon Valley Bank had, you know, a handful of people controlled 35,000 corporate accounts. And they just left, you know, $140 billion or something over a course — a course of two days. That’s not happening at other regional banks. They don’t have that issue.

(CROSSTALK)

HARLOW: What —

DIMON: Nor do they have all these other issues. So, it’s only a handful that were — that much offsides.

HARLOW: But then, what’s going on with First Republic? I mean, you lead the effort to swoop in, $30 billion from you and your fellow banks to try to steady First Republic. And you’ve acknowledged, we don’t even know yet if that worked.

DIMON: Yeah, that was an attempt to try to resolve, help, give them time to resolve a situation. We represent them, so I really can’t talk it about any more than that. And we hope it resolves, one way or another. So, that will come in the future.

But I don’t — I don’t think this is that kind of crisis that you’re going to have it ongoing forever. It will be — now Warren Buffett said, when the tide goes out — you mentioned something else. Rising rates is that tide going out. And if that tide goes out a lot — so I would tell people, you know, be prepared for higher rates. I don’t know that it’s going to happen, but be prepared you’re not —

HARLOW: Be prepared.

DIMON: — in that tide. You know, so —

HARLOW: You think the Fed raises again in May?

DIMON: Well, there are two rates. One is the short rate.

HARLOW: Yes.

DIMON: I do not know what they’re going to do and, obviously, they may not because — you know, the financial conditions.

But there’s also longer rates, and that has a different effect. And that the Fed does not control directly. That’s controlled by global investors, sentiment, supply and demand, and that’s gotten bad for sovereign debt. OK? So, you know, to me, yes, you have a chance of long rates going up and people might have (ph) to get used to higher for longer.

HARLOW: Higher for longer?

DIMON: Yes.

HARLOW: Get ready for that?

DIMON: I believe that is a — I think it has a higher outcome than other people. I’m not predicting it.

HARLOW: Right.

DIMON: Yes.

HARLOW: Is the American banking system truly safe and secure?

DIMON: Yes. I mean, the banks have extraordinary liquidity, extraordinary capital. When they report earnings next quarter, everything’s going to be quite good, in my opinion. They could handle not just one stress test but multiple ways of being stressed.

HARLOW: That’s the big guys —

DIMON: Yes.

HARLOW: — who have to abide by all those requirements, I’m talking about the midsize and little guys that don’t anymore.

DIMON: Well, they — they have far more requirements than you think. So I don’t think it was the requirement — some people think that they were —

HARLOW: The roll back.

DIMON: — loosened — that roll back literally had nothing to do with it.

HARLOW: How do you know?

DIMON: Because they had the same internal liquidity requirements, stress requirements, reporting requirements, supervisory requirements. They made mistakes.

HARLOW: It was different if they were under $250 billion in assets.

DIMON: Not as much as you’d think.

HARLOW: So all those senators that are saying it was wrong to roll them back — Democrats rolled it back too, some of them — those senators are wrong?

DIMON: Yeah. Look — look, it’s not — again, I — when you talk about regulations, that’s — they’re looking at one thing and I’m looking at multiple others. So they had high liquidity requirements, high capital requirements. They met the requirements. They had too much interest rate exposure and things should change. But they were not —

HARLOW: Yeah.

DIMON: — out of line with — you know, with regulations.

HARLOW: Well —

DIMON: And it wasn’t the regulatory change. It was other things. And by — in life, that’s going to happen. This notion that somehow you can make everything perfect is wrong. We —

HARLOW: I know, but —

DIMON: — we know —

(CROSSTALK)

HARLOW: — you don’t want a big, well-known bank to collapse.

DIMON: No, you don’t. But what you also really want is that every now and then something will happen, and the system can handle it in due course.

HARLOW: Let them —

DIMON: And —

HARLOW: — collapse?

DIMON: — that’s what the — yes. Failure is OK. You just don’t want this domino effect. And so, when you have a bank run, you end up with some kind of a domino effect.

I guess my point is, we — we are close to it. Get to the point where a bank can fail and it doesn’t have this kind of effect.

HARLOW: OK.

DIMON: And it just — monitoring, changing a few things can get you much, much closer to that.

HARLOW: Let me — let — let’s get into what would actually work. But look, what we do know is that regulators told Silicon Valley Bank, at least six times, you’ve got a problem and you have vulnerabilities, you need to fix them.

Because of the law change a few years ago, they didn’t have to fix them, they didn’t — it was just a recommendation. They didn’t fix those vulnerabilities.

DIMON: I don’t — I don’t think it had anything to do with the law change.

HARLOW: But —

(CROSSTALK)

DIMON: They should have fixed it. The regulators should have forced it.

HARLOW: Yeah — so let me ask you this question. Because you — the regulators can’t force it, should the public know when banks like that are warned multiple times or is the risk too great, that then there’s a run on the bank, if you wave a flag and say this bank has an issue?

DIMON: Yeah, so you may know more than I do about it, because I didn’t read all those —

HARLOW: I —

DIMON: — regulatory reports. But —

HARLOW: — doubt that.

DIMON: But my — my view is the regulators could have forced it. If my regulators called me up and said, we do not like X and you have to change it, I would change it.

HARLOW: You would —

(CROSSTALK)

DIMON: There was — there was no law change that made that not possible.

HARLOW: There was a 2021 regulation change that — it was said that was just guidance. So you’re saying it should be forced —

DIMON: No, it wasn’t just guidance.

HARLOW: OK.

DIMON: I have just guidance, too. But when they tell me I have to do it, I’m going to —

HARLOW: You do it.

DIMON: — do it.

HARLOW: You do it.

DIMON: I’m going to do it, yes.

HARLOW: So let’s talk about regulation. You say better regulation would not have prevented —

DIMON: No, no. It would have.

HARLOW: It — it would have. So what’s better?

DIMON: Well, I think, again there — we have liquidity discount windows.

HARLOW: Yeah.

DIMON: We have mortgage laws. We’ve got capital laws. We’ve got TLAC laws. We’ve got how you can use the discount window. We’ve got —

HARLOW: Our viewers don’t know —

(CROSSTALK)

DIMON: I know —

HARLOW: — TLAC laws —

(CROSSTALK)

DIMON: — I mean — there are a hundred rules. I’m saying, thoughtfully adjust the mix of how you do those. Make a bit of changes. If you have uninsured deposits, whether that means held-to-maturity, should you have debt issued, should the supervisors force something or not statutorily, not voluntarily —

HARLOW: Yeah.

DIMON: And yeah, I think you could make a lot of changes that would improve the system. But that’s always true in any system. I’ve never seen that not be true.

HARLOW: You — you write in your annual letter about what you call, your word, whack-a-mole —

DIMON: Yeah.

HARLOW: You seem to like that word. And politically motivated responses to the banking crisis — like what?

DIMON: Yeah. Well, I — no, I think very often when it comes to regulations, you have — this is the problem, and they try to fix that. But often, it has unintended consequences.

If you — if you want healthy regional banks, or community banks, you should also listen to them about what excess cost does to their ability to compete, you know, and what extra high-cost debt does to it. And — and have a thoughtful conversation about, what are the things we can do to — to make it easy for you and make the system safer.

HARLOW: I —

(CROSSTALK)

DIMON: And I believe that that’s doable.

HARLOW: I —

DIMON: Yeah, it’s not doable without the conversation and without the analysis.

HARLOW: I was reading back some — some — some things you said in 2008, when I just actually started covering you and covering the banks. And this was in the middle of the crisis, you’d just acquired Bear Stearns in a fire-sale trying to stabilize the banking system. And then you said, if you don’t worry in this business, you’re crazy. What are you most worried about right now in this business?

DIMON: Two — two things. Well, I think all this — quantitative tightening, the effect it has on long term rates, inflation higher for longer. That’s kind of the tide going out. So like, even when Bear Stearns went down, you think other people have seen that and said I have too much leverage, too much mortgage debt, too much this and made some changes.

Lehman went down six months later. I think they might have been able to fix that in the meantime. So that’s a little bit of a warning to people.

But I think this war in Ukraine — I think that is changing everything we think about in the world, how we should think about safety and security, even around food, energy, it’s changing economic relationships, it’s roiling the relationship with us and China. That is the most important thing. I mean, if you want to have a free and Democratic Western world and an American century in the next hundred — century, that’s what we got to focus on.

HARLOW: You said last year on that front, the autocratic world thinks that the Western world is a little lazy and incompetent and there’s a little bit of truth to that. Is that still how you see it?

DIMON: Yeah. I think — you know I think we do a lot of things that — first of all, we’re in a great position. So you know for the American public we have food, water, energy, we’re the most prosperous nation the world’s ever seen. The most innovative. Just got to Atlanta. Go to – not just Silicon Valley but it’s in Atlanta too, it’s in New York, it’s in Brooklyn, you know it’s all over the place.

We have a — the GDP per person is $70,000 plus. China’s is $15,000. They import 10 million barrels of oil a day. They don’t have the Atlantic and the Pacific. They have a very complicated neighborhood. They’re — you know they’re angering their neighbors who are all starting to rearm. We’ve got a great hand. On the other hand, we haven’t done a very good job taking care of our lower-paid citizens, our inner-city schools, immigration, taxation, and I think people should pay their taxes.

Litigation, which you know, it cost 1 percent of GDP and if it was — if it created more fairness in life, I’d say I was good but it’s capricious, arbitrary, slow. You know and I — so I can go on and on about — mortgages for your — you already heard about affordable housing. You know we all agree with that.

But very well the problem with affordable housing isn’t capital, it’s local zoning laws. So if America just got out of its own way, I think we go up 3 percent a year. Not — yeah.

HARLOW: Right. Let’s get to that because there’s positives that you write about in American growth. Such as sticking on sort of the world right now with global alliances. Are you worried about how close Iran, Russia, and China are to one another right now and are getting to one another, do you think about that? You’re a student of history.

DIMON: Yeah. I mean if you were going to ally with the Western World and America and Europe and the Western World or you’re going to ally with, you know, Iran and Russia. I mean please, am I worried? Not really.

HARLOW: That doesn’t worry you?

DIMON: No.

HARLOW: It worries some of our top generals.

DIMON: Well, no I — OK. You said military. Yes, you should worry about geopolitics, but I just told you what a great hand America has. Same with, kind of, Europe. What we should be doing is making sure we’re with allies not just militarily but economically, strategically, diplomacy, development finance, you know agree — have the rest of the world want to join us.

So if you’re India, would you rather be part of that group or part of the Western world?

HARLOW: Are we doing enough to entice?

DIMON: No, not enough. No. I think — you know Bob Gates in his book, probably called the Symphony of Power or something like that.

HARLOW: Yes.

DIMON: Said the symphony includes diplomacy, development finance, to having business involved and helping develop, you know, Africa or Latin America, parts of Asia. I think we could do a far better job courting that as a policy. I think, by the way, the administration thinks that too. And — and the other thing is but you can’t take trade off the table. So the first thing we do is we take trade off the table right from the start.

You know trade may be the most important thing for these countries. And while there are legitimate complaints about trade, we can do it better, we can do it right and we should be very thoughtful about it.

HARLOW: Before we move on to broader economy, I do want to get back to one question on bank and then I wanted to ask you. Should the FDIC insure more than $250,000? Because I think a lot of people feel right now, after what we’ve seen, that every deposit is just insured with no ceiling.

DIMON: You know, I think, probably. But it goes back to my thing about regulations. If you do this, you don’t need to do that. If you do this, you don’t need to do that. If you do them both, you can hurt. So, just be very thoughtful, but probably we should raise the deposit insurance.

HARLOW: To what?

DIMON: I don’t know yet. I mean, again, you got to do the analysis on that.

HARLOW: What about —

DIMON: But I think that would help community banks.

HARLOW: It would help —

DIMON: Yes. Yes.

HARLOW: — raise it? OK. So, final question on that. Should the — should banks like yours, the big guys with the most assets that, you know, are — have an implicit guarantee that you’re essentially not going to fail, pay a higher percentage in the deposit insurance?

DIMON: Oh, God, I don’t know. I’ll leave that —

HARLOW: Progressive?

DIMON: — I’ll leave that to everybody else.

HARLOW: You have no opinion on that?

DIMON: No.

HARLOW: If you guys should pay more into it?

DIMON: But if we were too big to fail, by the way, our bonds wouldn’t trade the way they trade, just so you know. And you were — and the market said so.

HARLOW: OK, talk about the economy. You wrote a lot about this in your annual letter. Has this banking crisis — even though you think it’s almost over, which I’m really glad to hear, though, increase chances of a recession here?

DIMON: Yes. But I — I look at it like it’s not definitive. It’s just like another weight on the scale.

HARLOW: OK.

DIMON: I think of it as — you know, people who say it’s like raising rates another 50 basis points or something like that, I — we are seeing people reduce lending a little bit, cut back a little bit, pull back a little bit. It won’t necessarily force recession, but it is recessionary.

HARLOW: Storm clouds ahead, you say maybe some —

DIMON: Yes.

HARLOW: — in the economy?

DIMON: Yes, I mentioned the QT, higher inflation for longer, the war. Those are — those are pretty strong things. If you look at history since World War II, we’ve not, kind of, faced it like that. It’s still early in that. That war, going for longer. We don’t really know the outcome in QT. I think we’ll be writing about QE and QT for 50 years.

HARLOW: Quantitative tightening and quantitative —

DIMON: Yes, quantitative tightening, quantitative easing —

HARLOW: — easing? OK. But Jamie, we can’t just focus on the risks —

DIMON: And the fiscal spending, which is enormous, yeah.

HARLOW: Yes. We can’t just focus on the risks because you even write, if you do that, it clouds your judgment.

DIMON: Yes.

HARLOW: You see a lot of positives in this economy. I mean, you talk about America’s GDP, you think, being more than 2x in 20 years. What’s ahead that is good?

DIMON: We’re going to have — whatever we go through in the next couple years, America, in almost every 10-year period going back all through our history, is much better 10 years later than it was before. That includes 1940 to 1950. That includes 1930 to 1940.

And so, the health of America is the strength of its people. It’s human capital. It’s brain power, it’s capability, it’s capital markets. We had the, you know, widest, deepest, most transparent capital markets the world’s ever seen, and that includes venture capital, private equity, media. We’ve got open media, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise. But the most important in that is freedom of people to do what they want. Like, if you’re starting a — so there’s two wonderful ladies —

HARLOW: Yes.

DIMON: — starting a business here —

HARLOW: Yes.

DIMON: It’s that. It’s the — that is — that’s at the heart of America, and that’s still there. That has not gone away. And we should applaud it. I mean, we should sing– I wrote in my letter, when I talked about all the stuff we do to help society and communities and philanthropy —

HARLOW: Yes.

DIMON: — and DEI. I said, but a lesson I shall not forget, I’m a red-blooded, full-throated, free-market, free-enterprise capitalist. OK? We should applaud free enterprise. We should sing from the hills the benefits while we fix the negatives, as opposed to denigrate the whole thing.

HARLOW: Or we could just screw it up and default.

DIMON: Not as long as I’m alive, boy, we’re going to be — keep fighting this one.

HARLOW: You think that Congress is going to get it together in the next few months and raise the debt ceiling?

DIMON: Oh, the debt ceiling?

HARLOW: That’s what I’m talking about.

DIMON: Oh. Yes.

HARLOW: You do?

DIMON: I — the only question is, how close they get it before they do it because you’ll feel the pain before it happens.

HARLOW: How much pain, even if we don’t default?

(CROSSTALK)

HARLOW: If we get to the brink?

DIMON: I think it’s a bad idea. And, you know, we — the — our government get — debt could be downgraded again. This economy is the pillar of the world economy. This economy is the pillar of — taking care of Americans, making sure our military is strong, and making sure that people want to be part of our alliances. That you want to be part of the American group that, you know, tries to keep the world safe for democracy.

Yes, that’s important. So the closer we get to that the more we’re going to damage all of that. And then you’ll see it in the markets. And that will — that will scare people.

HARLOW: Well, I hope Washington’s listening. The position of the Biden White House now is it will not negotiate with Republicans and the Republicans, many of them, Kevin McCarthy, don’t want to pass a clean — they want concession. So should the Biden White House negotiate?

DIMON: I think one of the great lessons of the last 20 years is that if you can’t pass things with bipartisan support, you shouldn’t pass it. I mean it — we — yes, everyone should negotiate to do the right thing for the country. And I don’t — I don’t want to get involved in the debate about the Republicans who want to reduce the deficit, I kind of agree with that. The Democrats who would like now to get rid of the debt ceiling crisis.

But people have tortured each other over and over. I rather one day we get rid of the torture. But in the meantime, yes, I’d like to be resolved and when I go to Washington all the — all the — most of the people there know how serious this is and they want to get it to resolution. You’ve even heard Kevin McCarthy talking about that, Mitch McConnell, you know President Biden in his own way.

HARLOW: Let’s hope. Let’s talk about politics. Let’s turn to politics. You famously said just a few years ago, 2019, “my heart is Democratic, my brain is kind of Republican.” Our country, our politics have changed a lot since then. I wonder if that’s still the case.

DIMON: It is still the case. I think we can do a better job of lifting up all of our citizens. I already mentioned education and work skills and stuff like that. I think we have to be a little more rational about the world. Free enterprise is a wonderful thing. You know free market capitalism, properly regulated, has lifted billion peoples out of poverty.

We’ve got to educate the American public how important it is and if the foundation of the strength of America is the strength of the economy.

HARLOW: What does — what does that mean, my heart is Democratic, my brain is Republican. What’s leading Jamie Dimon right now? His heart or his brain?

DIMON: I’m usually led by my heart, but my brain part is saying —

HARLOW: But the Democrat.

DIMON: — if we’re going to spend money, we should spend it wisely. It’s not enough to say oh we’re going to spend all this money building highways. How many miles at what cost in what time period? It’s not enough to talk about being green when we can’t get permits to build solar, wind, or pipelines, which would be green because gas is going to replace coal. And if we’re just not completely rational about sophisticated comprehensive policy. And I think the Republicans probably have that a little bit better.

HARLOW: A little bit better, the Republicans right now. Speaking of the Republican Party, the front runner for 2024 is former President Donald Trump. He has been indicted and faced criminal charges this week. Do you expect that to have any kind of impact — adverse impact on the economy, all this turmoil?

DIMON: Not really. You know if you look at America, there are 325 million Americans, you know, 165 million go to work every day, and their primary concern is their family, their community, their kids and things like that. So I don’t think that’s going to change the course of the economy that much.

HARLOW: You were on President Trump’s business council until it was dissolved. Do you think a second Trump term would be good for the U.S. economy?

DIMON: I’m not going to answer that question.

HARLOW: Why?

DIMON: I don’t want to.

HARLOW: But it’s not about the man, it’s about whether his policies would be good for —

DIMON: You know when I look at policies, OK, there are policies that he did that are good. OK. And you know I think the tax reform actually brought $1 trillion back to America.

The black community had the lowest unemployment rate ever in his last year because it grew the economy. And so I think, you know, there are growth strategies that matter. He had some of those. And — but that’s not supporting him. That’s just saying that’s true.

HARLOW: OK.

DIMON: I would say the same thing about any president. The things they did I thought were good or things they did that I thought weren’t good but —

HARLOW: You have called out the Biden administration for not playing more of a leadership role in energy, especially you said, look, America should have been pumping more oil and gas should have been supported. This administration did just approve more drilling in Alaska, good start?

DIMON: It’s a good start but it’s just a start. I mean it is a long-term strategy to me that oil and gas and the American public should know this, it’s not secure. And if it’s not secure and affordable, it’s bad for the climate.

All that happened because we weren’t pumping more is that more coal is used, and not just in India, Philippines, China, and Indonesia, but Germany, and Netherlands and France turned back on their coal plants.

Save and affordable is critical. The transition, by the way, the best — the easiest way to do CO2 is to reduce coal with gas. So therefore you need pipelines. But we’re not — you know look at us, we’re not approving pipeline permits, but nor are we approving solar, wind, grid. Like we’re — we’re really stuck in our own underwear on this one.

HARLOW: Stuck in our own underwear?

DIMON: We — we — we have to do a better job. And —

HARLOW: Can I ask you —

DIMON: Yeah.

HARLOW: — about a few states before — before we go? You guys have more employees now in Texas than in New York.

DIMON: Yeah.

HARLOW: And you said it shouldn’t have been that way. Why is it that way?

DIMON: Texas is — is completely welcoming. So if you look at it in multiple ways, low income taxes, low corporate taxes and easy to get space, they want you — you know, the mayors call and they have great universities, they now have — you know, if you look at Dallas, they now have great arts and science. It’s become a competitive world. When I started working, that wasn’t true. Now with cities around the world, they’re pretty competitive.

HARLOW: You (ph) —

DIMON: And I think every city should say, you know, what’s the competition? And they should be thoughtful about that. You have the highest individual taxes, the highest corporate taxes, the highest estate taxes, anti-business, you can’t — look at — you know, New York didn’t allow Amazon to build a great headquarters there. Like, was that good —

HARLOW: A little more context to that but —

DIMON: I understand that, but it’s just — but why would you try to build in New York then?

HARLOW: You’re building huge — huge —

DIMON: Yeah, but we’re —

(CROSSTALK)

HARLOW: — new headquarters right in the middle of New York.

(CROSSTALK)

DIMON: It’s one of the best buildings the world’s ever seen. Yeah.

HARLOW: You love Florida. In fact a few weeks ago you said you were very pro-Florida. You’re growing there. Does Governor DeSantis punishing Disney for taking a public stand on social and diversity issues give you pause?

DIMON: Not directly, no.

HARLOW: Really? Because just this week Bob Iger said that’s anti-business and anti-Florida. And he said it’s punishing a company for exercising a constitutional right.

DIMON: Yeah. I’m not going to get involved in all the social and stuff like that. We support the LGBT community aggressively and actively. But when you — but when you talk about —

(CROSSTALK)

HARLOW: And you’ll still do that in Florida despite DeSantis?

DIMON: Yes.

HARLOW: OK. We have to go pretty soon but I — I do want to ask you a few more things. I want to ask you about something that is in the news — that JPMorgan is in the news about a former client of yours and that is Jeffery Epstein. JPMorgan is being sued now by the U.S. Virgin Islands. They’re alleging that your bank helped facilitate payments to Epstein’s victims and benefited from human trafficking while ignoring warnings. Do those allegations have merit?

DIMON: So I — you know I talk about the current litigation except to say that whenever these things come up, we have some of the best lawyers in the world — compliance, out of the DOJ, out of SEC important divisions who review all of these things and make decisions at the time based on what they know, as best as they know.

HARLOW: You’re going to be deposed we’ve learned now in this case in the spring. In retrospect, Jamie, do you think JPMorgan should have acted more quickly after Epstein pleaded guilty to one of these charges in 2008 because he was your client for five more years?

DIMON: Hindsight is a fabulous gift.

HARLOW: We’re going to end on Artificial Intelligence. You find it fascinating, in your words, staggering, the tip of the iceberg. You guys are using ChatGPT. What’s this going to do to our economy?

DIMON: I think we’ll be OK. Every technology that’s ever been adopted was good for the economy. And you know I tell people if you go back to 1900, 40 million people worked on farms. You know technology is now 1 million people. Are we worse off? No. 39 million people now doing other things. So the Internet, electric power, computers all made us better off. Our GDP per person is $70,000. Yes, this is —

HARLOW: Per person, what if we get replaced?

DIMON: But you won’t be. It’ll — it’ll just change how you work and add things.

HARLOW: Really?

DIMON: But — but if it did — OK, but if it did then society could step in and make sure it’s done in a way that people could have jobs and good-paying jobs, but we get the benefit from it. The other thing I should point out about A.I., there’s a downside. Bad guys are going to use it too.

HARLOW: Yep.

DIMON: So, you know, for people like us we use it for all these things, we also have to, you know, it’s like think of risk and fraud and marketing and errors, you know, and helping clients. We also have to use it to combat — combat bad guys, in the cyber world, the fake ID world and things like that.

So, I think it will be a plus but if — do a thought exercise. Two million truckers, if they’re going to lose their jobs tomorrow because of, you know, A.I. driving, you know, and they’re going to go from $75,000 a year to the next job at 25 — that would destroy families. I wouldn’t do that. I would phase it in over time, have retraining, you know —

HARLOW: So, even if you could doesn’t mean you should.

DIMON: Even if you could does not mean you should. That’s where society should step in and government should step in and make sure that this helps, you know, kind of everybody and then –

HARLOW: Very interesting.

DIMON: — if there’s someone who’s going to get hurt at the low end do something about it. Analysis, think about it, retrain, reskill, help them move or whatever to have probably a better job.

HARLOW: Jamie Dimon, I really appreciate it. I always learn a lot talking to you.

DIMON: Thank you, Poppy.

HARLOW: Thank you very much.

KELLY EVANS: Welcome back, we've been talking to the big names at JP Morgan's virtual healthcare conference throughout the day today, and our next guest is one of the biggest. JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon joins us now along with CNBC's Bertha Coombs. Bertha?

BERTHA COOMBS: Thanks very much, Kelly. And Jamie, thank you so much for joining us. Had really hoped that we'd be able to do this in person. I want to get to healthcare but given where the markets are today and some interesting comments you made during the keynote just now, I wanted to start off with the economy. Your sense says that the economy's in good shape, what's telling you that?

JAMIE DIMON: Bertha, I'm thrilled to be here. I think is our first interview together. So I look forward to it. And you know, when you look at the economy, the consumer, okay – now this is all respect to the fact that this is not true for all consumers and there's some still suffering and we're still kind of working through this. But the consumer balance sheet has never been in better shape. They're spending 25% more today than pre Covid. They've got $2 trillion in their checking accounts either have the wherewithal to spend more. They pay down a lot of debt. The debt service ratio has never been better since we've been keeping records for 50 years. Home prices are up, stock prices are up, jobs are plentiful and wages are going up. And that all tells you what's going to happen in the future. They're in pretty good shape. And businesses, confidence is high, they've got plenty of cash and capital. So underlying, we've had this strong economy. The numbers are herky jerky – inflation, growth, employment, unemployment, people going back to work, the great resignation – but that underlying stuff is paramount and is pushing you know – we're going to have, what, the best growth year we've ever had this year I think since you know, maybe sometime after – before the Great Depression. And so next year will be pretty good too. But obviously there's some negatives out there, but those things look pretty good. The market is different Bertha. And you know, the market can have its own fluctuations and unrelated to the economy. I think you need this kind of grown to justify the market. So we're kind of expecting that the market will have a lot of volatility this year as rates go up and people kind of redo projections and look at you know, the effect of interest rates and businesses differently than they did before.

COOMBS: One of the things that the market is focused on is the Fed. Goldman Sachs coming out this morning saying they now predict that the Fed may actually raise rates four times this year. You think the Fed may be able to engineer a soft landing though?

DIMON: I hope so. You know, listen, Bertha, no one knows the future. And again, I think we really should do is go back to March of 2020. We were on our way to 15% unemployment, a lot of people died from Covid and no known vaccine. Now we've got an unemployment of 4%, the consumer in good shape, business is in good shape. You know, and those things are really good. The Fed, you know, you can say that they should have started doing QE a little bit early and stuff like that. But you know, if we're lucky, they can engineer a slowdown and you'll see inflation coming down. You know, a lot of people project inflation be 2.3% at the end of this year, I don't. I think it's going to be higher. But you know, if we're lucky, the Fed will slow things down, we'll have what they call a soft landing. You know, and it's going to be a little bit like threading the needle. So you can't look at anything and say, ""That's my projection,"" because you really don't know. It is possible inflation is worse than they think and they raise rates more than people think. I'd personally be surprised if it is just four increases next year. You know, I think that four increases of 25 basis points is a very, very little amount, and very easy for the economy to absorb.

COOMBS: It's interesting, I thought one of the things that you said was that if we do get a Fed induced recession, that doesn't have to be painful or long.

DIMON: Yeah, if you look at history, okay, and, you know, there's no common, you know, one type of recession. But a fairly common one is Fed raising rates to slow down the economy, overheated economy to kind of keep inflation in check. And if I remember correctly, if you look at the six of them, some of them are just short. They were, you know, six months, nine months long. You didn't even go into negative growth really for much more than a quarter or so. And so, you know, and unemployment goes up and not a lot. So, hopefully, that's the case. I do think you have underlying all of that a very strong consumer, very strong businesses. And, you know, hopefully, maybe Omicron – we don't know what the future variance will be, but hopefully Omicron may be putting this COVID-19 in rearview mirror. And if that's true, we may have a very, very good Spring.

COOMBS: You know, obviously, healthcare has been one of the areas that's been causing inflation for a long time but given that inflation is so hot, it seems relative now. Switching to healthcare, I want to talk about your new venture. You launched Morgan Health last year, you tapped Dan Mendelson, the founder and CEO of Avalere Health, to lead it and one of the big parts of that is that you've got $250 million you're going to put to work in venture investments. Why is that so important?

DIMON: So, look at the big picture here. So, America's got some of the best healthcare in the world, pharma, doctors, medicine, hospitals, I'm a beneficiary of that, but it's 18% of GDP. The rest of the world, the developing world is at 9% and we don't have the best outcomes, returnee care or obesity or cancer care, blood pressure is worse than a lot of folks so that we can acknowledge those problems and attack them. So, we're attacking from the employer standpoint, we've got fabulous people who manage our healthcare, but, but, but Dan Mendelson hired a great group of people and who can be using things like AI and cloud accountable care so we're trying this thing in Columbus through Vera, where we're gonna try to get people more primary care physicians to help them navigate, you know, through the healthcare system. If you just do a better job managing people's blood pressure or managing musculoskeletal diseases, you can have better outcomes at a lower cost if you can intervene properly, if you get more people do wellness programs. So and I think AI and cloud will do a lot here so, you know, we hope for better outcomes for our folks through better healthcare and more affordability and as part of that effort, the team is also looking at the racial healthcare like, you know, it is true that people who are lower income have worse healthcare than people with higher income and we should do something about that. I should point out to the people on CNBC, JPMorgan for years has subsidized healthcare much more for lower paid individuals than for higher paid, part of it in recognition of that.

COOMBS: I have talked to Dan about some of the efforts that they're doing and they've gotten, going very quickly. You've got one contract in Columbus, Ohio. You have 38,000 employees that is going to be based on trying to manage chronic conditions and then you're working on a deal with Kaiser Permanente out in California to deal with these health equity issues and try to bring down those health disparities. But you're also spending $1.8 billion a year on healthcare. Certainly, you are intent on bringing those costs down. How do you measure success here? Is it about outcomes, or is it about bringing costs down?

DIMON: It's really about outcomes, you know, outcome. And you make a very important point we spend like $35 billion a year in salaries, $2 billion a year in healthcare, that 2 billion maybe most important that's 250 million people, they take care of themselves, they have better lives, they're more productive, they're happier, they're taking care of their kids so that is so important. We get that right and it's all about better outcomes. Better outcomes is that we know you that we find out that you hide your diabetes, we do something about it. We find out you have blood pressure, we do something about it. If you want to get you to navigate through the healthcare system and more and more transparency and more affordability, but part of it will be affordability, both for the economy, the companies and the individuals because the thing they complain a lot about is the cost of healthcare, like this whole thing about surprise billing. You know, hospitals should stop surprise billing. The reason why I know about it who said we will not allow physician cracks in here that are out of network. And so, there are million things we can do for transparency and getting consumers healthier, happier, and probably even at a lower cost.

COOMBS: You know, a lot of what you've already started to do with Morgan healthcare is what was the intent and the aim of your venture with Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway if Haven never got off the ground? What went wrong there?

DIMON: Yeah, look, we learned a lot from our prior ventures but we're on the same course. We started with, the parties went different ways. We've learned a lot and we're continuing on. So, you know, and we've learned a lot part is important. Jeff Bezos always talks about, you know, failures you learn from something so I don't worry that much about what went wrong. What I'm worried about what we learned, how we go forward. We're lucky to get Dan Mendelsohn and his team involved. These folks are experts in, in healthcare and doctors and science and AI and working very closely with Bernadette and her team at JPMorgan doing these complex healthcare things. So, I am convinced that this thing will have better outcomes for our employees. And then if we've learned things, we're going to share with the world too. And there will be in my view and you've seen it already, a lot of policy things that people can do around hospital publishing prices, you know, surprise billings, I think telemedicine digital site and that digital medicine and, you know, AI will really help you over time too.

COOMBS: One of the most important healthcare issues that you're dealing with right now, of course is COVID and the new Omicron surge. At Citi, they have said that employees who are not vaccinated by the end of this week will lose their jobs. Where do you stand right now on mandates if they are upheld by the courts which it appears for now at least they are, and what does that mean for back to work?

DIMON: Yeah, so you know, we, we believe that going to work is a good thing that people deal with each other for innovation and creativity and just just humanity is a good thing. And obviously, we're not we're here unlike any of the policies we ever had. We're not trying to be consistent because as you pointed out, there are different laws and different requirements and cities and states and schools and so here we're adjusting locally. So in our main headquarters building, we have a vax mandate but remember, 97% of the people are vaxxed so to go to the office, you have to be vaxxed and, you know, if you aren't going to get vaxxed, you won't be able to work in that office. We're not going to pay you to not work in the office. So in other parts of the world where it would be quite different than that but we want people to get vaxxed. But going back to work where, again, we have the same strategy, where to go back to work, of course, you have more hybrid and more flexibility as long as it works for the clients. This notion that it can only work for employees isn't a fair notion. So and we're the other question is I think people spend too much, we don't have to answer this right away. Let's get back and we'll find ways to get to flexibility that makes sense and the tools that do that and so, I'm quite comfortable life, airflows look a lot like life did before. I also want to point out the American people if I remember correctly, 100 million people go to work every single day. So all the time that everyone's sitting at home talking about this, that was 40, 50 million people. Military goes to work, police goes to work, firemen go to work, sanitation, agricultural workers, bank branches, manufacturing, Amazon, UPS, FedEx, supply, logistics, meatpacking, you're talking about 40 or 50 million who, it's great there's flexibility and overtime, you know, if you can accommodate that, that's a great thing, but it's also got to work for the company. And so we'll find out ways to, you know, have the best of both worlds here. Like I said, it doesn't be the same everywhere. So as buildings get to 95% and 97% vaxxed in certain states, that may end up with a different policy than a different state. And that's fine, too. We're not looking for nirvana here. You're not going to find it.

COOMBS: Jamie, thank you so much for joining us, and I'm hopeful that maybe we can follow up on some of the progress that you make with Morgan Health in person one of these days.

DIMON: So Bertha, thank you very much for having me. I just want to point out, I like the fact that a bipartisan infrastructure bill, please, please, please, let's all work together and collaborate. All of our problems are fixable. All of them and American leadership is really needed desperately.

COOMBS: Alright, thanks again. Jamie. Jamie Dimon, Chairman & CEO of JPMorgan from the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference."
Jamie Dimon’s big win,
,"This is an audio transcript of the FT News Briefing podcast episode: ‘Jamie Dimon’s big win’

Marc Filippino

Good morning from the Financial Times. Today is Tuesday, May 2nd, and this is your FT News Briefing.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

China is leading the world in IPOs and Germany wants more immigrants. Plus, we’ll talk about what JPMorgan gets out of its rescue purchase of First Republic.

Brooke Masters

Well, first off, I think Jamie Dimon gets to be the hero. I mean, he likes to be the hero. He thinks of himself as the dean of banking.

Marc Filippino

There is more to it than just that, I promise. I’m Marc Filippino and here’s the news you need to start your day.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Initial public offerings have dwindled in the US and Europe. Companies are holding off with all this economic and financial uncertainty. In China, though, it’s a very different story. Pandemic restrictions are over. There are new streamlined rules for listings in Shanghai and Shenzhen. And so far this year, Chinese IPOs have raised five times as much money as IPOs in the US. Chinese companies have raised about $20bn in new stock market listings, according to Dealogic. That’s more than half of all the funds raised by IPOs around the world.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

The fate of First Republic has been decided. The struggling lender will be swallowed up by America’s biggest bank, JPMorgan Chase. US regulators brokered the deal and made the announcement early morning yesterday before markets opened. This follows two other nerve wracking bank collapses: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. To talk more about this, I’m joined by a very sleep-deprived Brooke Masters. Hey, Brooke.

Brooke Masters

Hey, Marc.

Marc Filippino

So this is now the third bank the FDIC has taken over in the past two months. Are people confident that if it’s gonna be the last or is there still concern about lingering contagion?

Brooke Masters

Nobody wants to cause a bank run by saying, oh, my goodness, more banks are gonna fail. But there have been comparisons to the S&L crisis of the 1980s, which saw something like 900 banks fail over the course of a decade. So I think no one wants to say never say never. It’s a tough question.

Marc Filippino

OK. So some people are comparing this crisis to the savings and loan crisis. But there’s also been a lot of confidence since this deal has closed. I mean, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon came out and said that the crisis is over. I mean, that takes a ton of confidence.

Brooke Masters

Yup. But, you know, Jamie Dimon does not lack for confidence. I think other people are not as sure. The big concern, I think, is commercial real estate, which is having a hard time because it is a sector that is always heavily affected by rising interest rates, which is what we’re having right now. Plus, work from home means that lots of companies don’t need as much office space. So it’s already a sector under pressure and it is a sector that a lot of the lending comes from these regional banks, which is where the problems have been so far. So if commercial real estate goes bad, it will hit banks that are already having a tougher time. And I think that’s what people will watch. If commercial real estate sorts itself out without big problems, then it’s not a big deal. But if it has trouble, that is going to be an issue.

Marc Filippino

Right. We actually said on yesterday’s show that Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway, has flagged commercial real estate as a big issue. We’ve also talked about the issues in Europe. It’s definitely one we’re gonna watch. But I want to go back, Brooke, and talk about the deal itself. What exactly is in it for JPMorgan?

Brooke Masters

Well, first off, I think Jamie Dimon gets to be the hero. I mean, he likes to be the hero. He thinks of himself as the dean of banking. He’s one of the last surviving CEOs from who survived the financial crisis. He runs America’s biggest bank. He can’t ever buy other banks in a normal circumstance because there’s a law in the US preventing a bank with more than 10 per cent of deposits from buying any other one. JPMorgan can only buy when there is a collapse. So I think he’s very keenly aware of that. What they get in First Republic is a bank that had a tremendous reputation for brilliant customer service. Its customers love it. So it’s getting that and it obviously is losing, it’s gonna get rid of the First Republic name, so it’s gonna have to work hard to hang on to these customers. But JPMorgan has been trying to grow its wealth management division, and it’s sort of mass affluent, which is like rich but not super-rich division. And that’s exactly what First Republic does. And so JPMorgan’s gonna get some really dedicated staff and hopefully have a chance to hang on to some really, you know, striver clients. I mean, these are entrepreneurs who are making it. You know, they’re often in the younger part of their careers and they’re, you know, over time they’re gonna become really rich. And if they decide to stay, it’s gonna be a great deal.

Marc Filippino

Brooke, what are your final thoughts on the past few days? I mean, we’re talking, and you are on like 5 hours of sleep, if that I mean, that’s probably being generous. I mean, what did the last 48, 72 hours feel like and what do you feel like coming out of it?

Brooke Masters

You know, I would like to believe that this is the last big, you know, wobbling bank I’m gonna cover. You know, I did 2008 and I had a nice break. I would like (Marc laughs) to believe that I’m going on to another break. I worry a bit that we are not yet quite at the problems that are causing these bank runs. Hopefully, it won’t be as scary. But the reality is the interest rates are rising really quickly. The US banking sector is a very large boat and it’s kind of trying to turn and adjust to the fact that the way it’s been doing business for the last 15 years has to change. Cracks and strains show. I would really like not to be up again until, it was I actually got two and a half hours of sleep, so I’m, five would be great. (Marc laughs) But, you know, I think it would be surprising if other cracks did not show. But they may not be as bad as this. I mean, this was a big bank to go down. This bank was worth $25bn in the middle of February. It’s now, if you own shares in it, it’s worth nothing.

Marc Filippino

Amazing. Brooke Masters is the FT’s US financial editor. Thank you, Brooke.

Brooke Masters

Thanks for having me.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Marc Filippino

Businesses in Germany have struggled with rising energy costs and supply chain issues. But the problem that’s eclipsed all of them is the country’s labour shortage. Germany’s labour minister, Hubertus Heil, told the FT’s Berlin bureau chief, Guy Chazan, that companies were desperate for staff. In the coming weeks, Germany’s parliament is expected to approve immigration reforms to address all this. Guy joins me now to talk more about it. Hello, Guy.

Guy Chazan

Hi there.

Marc Filippino

Guy, can you talk a bit more about how serious this worker shortage is right now in Germany?

Guy Chazan

Well, Germany definitely has a very serious problem in that it has a shortage of skilled workers, which is sort of rippled really throughout the economy now. And it’s affecting all industries, all sectors, the public sector, the private sector. I mean, Heil in the interview quoted a figure that said, that a statistic that said, that Germany will lack 7mn workers by 2035 if the government doesn’t do something. He warned that this would be a real brake on Germany’s economic growth. So it really is a very serious issue.

Marc Filippino

So as you report, there are these immigration reforms coming down the pike. Is it an overhaul, are they just tweaks?

Guy Chazan

They’re very much tweaks to the system, but they’re quite significant tweaks. I mean, basically it’s kind of making it a bit easier for people to work in Germany, even if they don’t have a German professional qualification. That’s been one of the big hurdles so far. They’re also introducing something called a chance card. It’s basically similar to the Canadian points-based system and that allows people to earn points based on their vocational training and experience, whether they have a connection to Germany and speak German and are younger than 35. And the more points you earn, the easier it will then be to come to Germany.

Marc Filippino

Is the government trying to recruit certain types of immigrants, Guy? For example, those with a certain skill or education level?

It’s really across the board, but there are certain areas of the economy where they really need skilled workers more than others. Predominantly the IT sector and Heil was sort of hinting that they’re gonna now do a massive kind of advertising and recruitment campaign in countries like India, which obviously have a lot of IT workers, to get them to come to Germany. He and the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, are going together to Brazil soon, and I think they’re also gonna be trying to recruit Brazilians into the German care system, because that’s another really, really serious problem. The country just does not have enough care workers and hospitals and care homes are really seriously suffering from that.

Are people worried that more immigration could lead to social or political conflict? I mean, can Germany even handle a new influx of immigrants?

Guy Chazan

It’s a tricky one. I mean, we now have this rightwing party called the Alternative for Germany, the AfD, which is doing quite well. And they’re very, very anti-immigration. So there is opposition to this among certain sectors of German society. But on the whole, Germany has over the last ten, 15 years, maybe 20 years, become a much more liberal place, which with less of a hang up about immigration. As you saw with the enormous influx of refugees from Syria, from the Middle East, from North Africa in 2015 and 16, when more than a million people arrived in Germany and they were absorbed very, very well. I mean, it was an extraordinary achievement really, to absorb that many people. And I think that has shown that Germany’s capacity to adapt and to be more inclusive and welcoming to foreigners, it’s really been a significant change in this country over the last generation or so.

,"WHEN: Today, Thursday, February 23, 2023

WHERE: CNBC's ""Mad Money""

Following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC exclusive interview with JPMorgan Chase Chairman & CEO Jamie Dimon on CNBC's ""Mad Money"" (M-F,6PM-7PM ET) today, Thursday, February 23rd. Video of the interview will be available on CNBC.com.

All references must be sourced to CNBC.

JIM CRAMER: Jamie, I saw a smile this morning and it's a smile that reminds me of who you are. You're a banker trying to get business for JPMorgan, but also change a neighborhood. Is that why you're here on 52nd in Philadelphia?

JAMIE DIMON: Look, we love Philadelphia. We now have 50 branches here on our way to 80. I was so happy you joined us in the community branch you got to see it in action – our people are happy, how proud we are of them.

CRAMER: Individual bank.

DIMON: And that one story about Khalif who got a mortgage from Tanika who I gave a big hug and she called him every single day. And that one mortgage – his whole family – talked about his family, the problems, they had rented the place for 25 years. That's changing the world. That one thing. And you know, the thing we didn't mention is we got rid of college to be required for a lot of jobs. We use that community branch, we use local, we hire local people, local vendors for food. It was a Black construction company that reconstructed the branch. We bring in small businesses, we give them advice. We've had like 60 events they told me there already. 60 events teaching people how to save money, how to start a business, how to do a mortgage and stuff like that. So it warms our heart. And I mentioned when I was there that a lot of our people, I told them you didn't get your job because your brain, your work ethic, which is part of it, you got your job because you have a heart and you care about people. Whether it's your employees or the person who walks in the front door of that branch.

CRAMER: And in a discriminate neighborhood. You know that. That was one point as I mentioned. A red line neighborhood. They couldn't get any mortgages.

DIMON: Well you know it better than us and we're trying to do things to reverse all the heritage of redlining, including doing things like including rent, which is not included in FICO scores. So you could be paying rent for 20 years, it's not included. But using alternative data like that to make them more you might not otherwise make.

CRAMER: Okay, so this morning, Wells Fargo lays off a lot of mortgage bankers. Is this the right time to expand a bank to get mortgages?

DIMON: Yeah, so we have expansion plans which we just do nonstop –

CRAMER: But the Fed, the Fed, the Fed. You forgot the Fed.

DIMON: Makes no difference to me. We open branches, hire bankers, build technology, nonstop. That's what we do. The mortgage business is a very tough business. So if you said as a business matter, that is true. So I'm very sympathetic to what you know, Charlie is going through. It's very tough regulatory, it's very tough legal. It's the profit margins move all over the place. So a lot of people are making different decisions. You've probably seen that 80% of the mortgage business is out of banks now, you know, and that's kind of unfortunate.

CRAMER: Now, I often struggle when I listen to you to think about well, is the government an impediment? Is the Fed an impediment? Or are these actually trying to help things to make them better?

DIMON: You know, I think the Fed has to do what they think is the right thing to do and you know look –

CRAMER: But you've talked to them. They're not doing what you think.

DIMON: They kind of are. I think we all know they were probably late, okay. And their models didn't really work. Inflation got out of control and then they kind of quickly caught up. So they'll probably pause at one point a little over 5%. Whether it's enough or not, we don't know. And I don't think it will be. I think that inflation will come down but maybe by the end of the year they have got to do a little bit more. But remember, inflation could be far worse than a mild recession. And so they've got to figure out what's the right thing for the long run, not just what's the right thing for next year or something like that. So I wish them – we all want them to do as well as they can.

CRAMER: But I still do not hear you say there will not be recession. I still hear you say that it could be a hard landing. I'm not getting away from that.

DIMON: Yeah, well, you can't avoid I mean, I look at the world as possibilities and probabilities. So there's still a chance for a soft landing or no landing. There's still a chance for hard landing and there's still a chance for what I call other because of Russia, oil, gas, migration, China, trade. Those are serious things. And I also point out we've never had QT before. And QT, the early part may be easy -- harder later – later parts might be a little harder. So I expect that will cause a lot of volatility in the markets at one point.

CRAMER: Now your banks probably – people don't know this – but your bank has the best Asian desk. You've had unbelievable relations with China. Did it have to go as awry as it is?

DIMON: No, but I think Covid set everyone way back where people didn't talk and they didn't relate to each other. I think Russia showed the world that the world is not safe for Western – completely safe with Western democracy. And you need American leadership that can coalesce the Western world. But you have what's happening today is you have a lot of countries around the world who do a ton of pick and choose between who they are going to lie with, who they want to trade with. We've got to put trade back on the table. I travel around the world and a lot of these countries are ""hey, if you're not going to trade with us and China's coming to walk in here."" So we need diplomacy, economic strategy, trade, very thoughtfully done with allies, and then private negotiation with China. We can take – I think we're doing a lot of right around national security. I think that's a cynic going on.

CRAMER: Okay, so I listen to you and I say okay, experienced banker, experience worldwide. 67, can't be JPMorgan forever. People who are running for president are in their 80s Why not Jamie?

DIMON: I've never been a politician. That's why –

CRAMER: Well maybe that is what we need.

DIMON: I would love to be anointed president. But you have to win. You have to run and there's almost no chance –

CRAMER: Yeah that's a problem. We saw that yeah.

DIMON: That would be a big problem.

CRAMER: That is absolutely the problem. Now, where are we as a country? How do we stand? Our natural resources are great, but our leadership is paralyzed because we have so many people in Washington who hate each other.

DIMON: Yeah I wouldn't be that dramatic about it.

CRAMER: Okay.

DIMON: If you look at the history of America, we've been through tough times, Revolutionary War, Civil War, World War I, Depression, World War II and a lot of things past that. And so huge resiliency, which Warren Buffett always talks about. The way Americans think about it is we are the most prosperous nation on the planet. And I'm going to contrast this to China just to put it in perspective. 75,000 per person GDP here versus 13 there. We have all the food, water and energy we need, okay, we've got the gifts of the founding fathers – freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise, freedom of capital. You can do what you want with yourself. You can start businesses, you can invest in things –

CRAMER: On 52nd street in Philly.

DIMON: You can do all that.

CRAMER: But they haven't given everybody – there's not been equal opportunity for people to get capital.

DIMON: We have done a terrible job lifting up the bottom 20% of society.

CRAMER: The government or the banks? Are you –

DIMON: Government.

CRAMER: -- taking leadership because the government has failed so many people.

DIMON: I think every institution should do something to help. Hire people, train people, open this community branch. But we also have to get with the government –we need good, effective competent government. And a lot of government policies backfired, but we need the inner city schools to get these kids ready to work. We need – we got rid of college to be required, but we need the schools to work. We need zoning, if you want more affordable housing – very often its zoning, you know, we need immigration policy –

CRAMER: Are you telling me that there's enough – that you would lend credit, give credit and your bank has enough savings and people have enough savings. That if we just were kind of Prometheus unbound when it comes to the economy, we'd be doing much better.

DIMON: I think so. I think we hold ourselves back because we don't have really effective public policy around regulations, taxation, immigration.

CRAMER: Is the American consumer good despite this?

DIMON: The American consumers in fabulous shape today.

CRAMER: Well, I'm not –what's the uncertainly here? I mean, yes, Ukraine. You've given me probably eight certainties to 2 uncertainties.

DIMON: So here it is. They're spending 40% more than pre Covid, they have a trillion and a half or something like that left their checking accounts, more than they had pre Covid. Jobs are plentiful. Wages still going up.

CRAMER: Millennials going to your bank?

DIMON: Yeah.

CRAMER: Or are they going to fintechs. Where? Is Square going to beat you.

DIMON: No. We are getting our share of everybody.

CRAMER: I'm baiting you. You're supposed to take that bait.

DIMON: I said no, they are not going to beat us. But the problem is that money is being spent down now, so it's going to, we think sometime by the end of the year, it'll be zero excess balance.

CRAMER: Well, that means good for the credit card business.

DIMON: And it is being eroded by inflation. So you can look at that and say, well, at the end of that, you'll have a little bit of a dip, but maybe not. You know, if we go into a recession, the consumer's in better shape because unlike '08 and '09 mortgages are well underwritten, even though people say ""oh my credit card debt,"" it's just normalizing.

CRAMER: Well, then the Fed with its method, meet x method of five and a half, six is not going to solve the inflation problem that you were just talking about.

DIMON: My view is that it might go a little bit higher.

CRAMER: Higher than six?

DIMON: Yeah, possibly.

CRAMER: Higher than six a lot of people are going to be thrown out –

DIMON: When you when I grew up, okay, like when I graduated school, I was 21 -- was 21 and a half percent. Things change. There's been a big sea change—

CRAMER: Buying treasuries at 14.

DIMON: Yeah, I still wouldn't buy treasuries today.

CRAMER: Well, okay, so north of six would be news. That's kind of news, Jamie.

DIMON: That will surprise people, yeah.

CRAMER: You don't want to kind of take that one. I mean, mortgages are— mortgages are like doing terrible things.

DIMON: I'm not saying it is going to do that –

CRAMER: You did say it is going to do that.

DIMON: I suspect it may have to go a little bit higher than five we're talking about. It could hit six –

CRAMER: The country's not ready for that.

DIMON: Well, things happen.

CRAMER: Layoffs, unemployment goes to 5% at that rate.

DIMON: It could, yeah.

CRAMER: We go back to five percent.

DIMON: But it could be again, if you're in the government, what you really want is the best long term outcome. Inflation is so insidious, that that could damage growth for 10 years. So they are trying to do the right thing –

CRAMER: But okay, so it's homes, it's food, it's wages. You have no control over food, but you talk about POS of Ag. Homes, it doesn't seem to matter. They don't build enough so we're always going – homes keep going up in price, it's a supply demand issue.

DIMON: Well, they are down 10% from their peak so keep that in mind.

CRAMER: Yes.

DIMON: And we need to supply more homes.

CRAMER: Yes we do.

DIMON: So affordable housing and all that, we need more. Yet you're absolutely correct. We're not building enough to keep up with the population. That's a good sign for the future the economy.

CRAMER: But the wages are only going to stabilize if enough businesses including ones that use JPMorgan fail.

DIMON: I don't think you need failure, but you know, when you have a recession, companies fail. But that's – hopefully that won't happen.

CRAMER: Can I leave on artificial intelligence? Something more positive. Your bank – everyone thinks that Nvidia, one of my favorite companies, it's all new. You guys have used artificial intelligence throughout. You've understood, you've been able to catch fraud. You've been able to get rid of a lot of jobs that are very difficult where people are actually talking to machines and they don't know it. I mean, is your bank – did you convene a meeting on this? Did you convene a meeting on accelerated computing?

DIMON: All the time. Years ago, I wrote about it years ago. And we actually hired Manuela Veloso who ran Carnegie Mellon here years ago. We have 100 people in research AI. We have thousands of data scientists, machine learning data folks and stuff like that. We run I think about 300 AI programs.

CRAMER: So you weren't surprised by ChatGPT.

DIMON: No, we were already doing stuff like that. Contracts –

CRAMER: Should the Fed be using it? Would they be better at their job if they were just plugging it in – should rates be at six.

DIMON: I don't think ChatGPT could figure that out quite yet.

CRAMER: But it sounds like your AI could.

DIMON: No, but we use it for things like risk fraud, marketing, prospecting. We move $10 trillion around the world and I go to zip zap it as we speak, but it's running through AI systems to make sure is it going to the right place, what are the patterns, what's the voice recognition –

CRAMER: Is 4% on the ten year the right place to be with ridiculous – isn't that ridiculously low?

DIMON: I think it's a little low, yeah.

CRAMER: Little low.

DIMON: Yeah.

CRAMER: Man, you couch it. It's very low. And capital markets kind of dried up. When are we going to see those numbers get better?

DIMON: Soon.

CRAMER: And interest income how come nobody cares and they think there's going to be – not interest income, it's going to be great, but people are now worried about bad loans. I'm not seeing or hearing from you that there's a lot of defaults.

DIMON: I don't expect a lot. I think you'll have – if you have a recession my view is you have what I consider a normal credit cycle. Losses will go up in a way that's quite predictable in a recession, unlike what happened in '08 and '09.

CRAMER: But we can't necessarily break an economy with 8% if many people are buying homes with cash, there are not enough homes. I've been trying to figure out what's going to go. What goes under or what stops to head off inflation?

DIMON: Well, I think the banking system's in fabulous shape.

CRAMER: Yes.

DIMON: Consumers will be going through a recession –

CRAMER: The consumers –

DIMON: -- In pretty good shape –

CRAMER: -- self consumer is the best ever? Best that you've seen as a banker?

DIMON: Yeah, pretty much.

CRAMER: Since 2005 is it the best?

DIMON: Pretty much, yeah.

CRAMER: Why am I so worried then? You just made me really worried –

DIMON: I'm not worried about the normal economic cycle. I would only worry about the abnormal stuff like the war in Ukraine, oil and gas.

CRAMER: Okay, you want to worry about existential not 52nd and Market. You're not worried about 52nd and Market?

DIMON: No.

CRAMER: I like that. That is a good place to leave it. Jamie Dimon. Chairman, CEO of JPMorgan. Thank you very much.

Jamie Dimon in Conversation with Eric J. Pan,
,"JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon joined ICI President and CEO Eric J. Pan for a lively discussion on Day 1 of the 62nd annual ICI General Membership Meeting, which took place on May 6, 2021. The conversation touched on Dimon’s vision for leadership in a post-pandemic world, the regulatory developments around sustainable finance, investor access to early-stage investment opportunities, the US economy and infrastructure, and more.

Transcript

Eric Pan, president and CEO of ICI: So, Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, it's an honor to have you here. Thank you for being here today.

Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase: Eric, thrilled to be here, and thrilled to be with all of you, though next time in person.

Pan: Well, we look forward to that. And we're going to hold you to that promise. So I wanted to start off by thinking about life before the pandemic. So back in 2019, you were the chairman of the Business Roundtable. And you oversaw something called the ""Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation."" Now, this statement made a lot of news, because you and 180 other CEOs outlined a fundamental commitment for companies to operate in the interest of customers, employees, suppliers, and communities—a much broader group than merely the shareholders.

Now, you fast forward [to] today, and obviously we have a lot of discussion about new regulation for climate change [and] diversity and inclusion. These are broader areas than enhancing shareholder value. So I'm wondering, should American companies embrace these new regulations as to be consistent with their responsibilities as you had outlined at the Business Roundtable?

Dimon: Yeah. So the short answer is no, because I don't think that's completely consistent, but I want to explain that. I sat in a meeting with a bunch of press one day, when I had just been made chairman of the Business Roundtable, and one of the press [said], ""You guys, all you care about is profits."" And I said, ""Well what do you mean?"" And they said, and they referred to a statement the BRT had made in 1989 or something. I got the statement. It basically said, fiduciary [and] shareholder value.

And what people have to understand is, when the public hears “fiduciary,” we're standing behind lawyers, and shareholder value, they hear, rapacious short-term profit-taking, which ironically is the worst thing for shareholder value. So the statement was more of an evolutionary thing, what CEOs actually do when they wake up in the mornings is do a good job for the clients. That's like number one. Because if you don't, you lose. Clients have to come back, and the way you do that is through employees.

And my view is, we shouldn't stand behind legalese or the courts, and I even told people, ""Don't [worry about] your general counsels."" Because all the general counsels will come back and say, ""You can't change it. It's fiduciary, Delaware court."" That's not talking to the American public.

And so, and of course, people extrapolate that, that therefore you have to do things. So I think it's perfectly reasonable that you...Shareholders and people ask us about ESG, environmental social good. And there are good things about that and bad things. So that does not mean that we have to agree with everything people are saying. I mean, we report a lot of that stuff. There are a lot of things that people ask us to do which are capricious, arbitrary, a waste of time, expensive, and will not accomplish the objectives of climate change.

So my view is, when it gets down to the detail, let's talk about the detail, and whether it makes sense to support that. I'm not against reporting. And I'll just give you one quick example, when they wanted to report CEO comp to median comp, which by the way, you all know my comp. You can look at our P&L, look at comp, and divide by 200,000 employees, you'll be roughly accurate. The reason we didn't want to do isn't because we were embarrassed; I'm not embarrassed of that. The reason is that it would cost $50 million to $100 million to implement a system to do it in a way that met all the terms.

For example, is it monthly average? Daily average? Does it include laying people off? Does it include FX adjustments? Does it include benefits? Does it include all these other things? How do you make adjustments for foreign countries? And it's just like, that doesn't accomplish anything. If you want to know the number, you roughly know the number. And so climate change can be a big one. I'm for it, but not some of the stuff people ask us to do, because it's a complete waste of time, again.

Pan: Right. Well, so it's interesting that you brought up climate change, because I did want to ask you a bit about sustainable finance. Because this, clearly, it's a priority for the Biden administration; it's a big policy priority out in the European Union. Even China is talking about doing more to fight climate change. And it seems like a big focus of what these policymakers are saying is, ""We need to get the financial system. Get financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase to redirect capital to greener companies, transitional technologies, and things of that nature.""

So they're putting a lot of pressure on firms like yours, as well as members here at ICI, to do more. I'd love to get your take as to whether or not you think this call on financial institutions to do more. Is this appropriate, and do you think banks like JPMorgan can do more?

Dimon: Yeah, so again, and we want to be a mature voice at the table, OK? Which is, I don't mind people saying banks should do a bunch of things. But what are those things? And it's kind of peculiar to me that they say you're going to accomplish….I think climate change is a real issue that we have to attack as a nation. Now, the BRT published a 40-page thing that goes industry by industry, including supporting a carbon tax. And by the way, if you don't support a carbon tax, you're barely being serious.

You think you're going to pound on banks and you're going to fix the problem? There are thousands of companies out there. China and India are far bigger polluters than America. So what we want to do is be a mature player at the table, and we talk about carbon intensity. You're not going to get rid of oil and gas for a long, long time. Now we, the world, uses 100 million equivalent barrels a day, or something like that. Gas is much more effective than coal, in terms of CO2. There are agricultural issues; you could do pipelines well or pipelines badly.

So we use the concept of carbon intensity. So a lot of people asking and reporting won't solve the problem. But at one point, when there are good standards that are applied broadly. And the other thing, which everyone should understand, because I know this is on your mind. If public markets don't do it, private markets will do it. If Americans don't do it, foreign companies will do it. So you need real standards around all of that if you want to get it right.

It's doable if we do it right as a nation and a world, we can do it at virtually no cost, and I really believe that. If we just impose rule after rule after rule, we're going to not accomplish anything at a huge cost. And that's the difference when I say doing it well, and doing the policy well, and not doing the policy well.

Pan: Right. So when you talk about standards, can you speak more as to what you mean? Because it sounds like you're not suggesting we need more SEC rules. Or we don't want the Fed to issue a new capital requirement on banks. So what's the alternative? If you were a policymaker, how can you incentivize this investment?

Dimon: Imposing a capital requirement on a bank is a little bit like whack-a-mole. It'll just go to the non-bank section. That's not going to solve it. But so my point is carbon intensity. So we have clients who call us up saying, ""Jamie, we're reducing our carbon intensity by 20 percent a year."" I even met with companies that are doing better pipelines, better things, and they're saying, ""Help finance the transition.""

So people should be asking, ""Are you financing a proper transition in a way that helps accomplish the goals of the nation? And is the legislation proper to accomplish those goals?"" So it's a much broader set than just pounding on banks. That will not accomplish the goal. So we're for the cause; we're for proper reporting when we know what it is.

So right now the SEC, the CFTC, and the Federal Reserve, and the OCC, and the FSA, and the PRA, if all these people are imposing rules on us about reporting, that doesn't necessarily accomplish the goal. The goal is to get less CO2. How are you going to do it? And the best way, carbon tax, emission trading things, proper industrial policy, really well thought through. And then you will accomplish reducing CO2.

And then, of course, we've already announced, I mean, JPMorgan's announced $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years of financing the new economy, OK? And there are great things out there, agricultural things, and like I said, cleaner technologies, batteries, solar, that will pay for themselves. This is not philanthropy; this is that they actually pay for themselves.

Pan: Got it. So I'm curious, if I could ask one more question on sustainable finance, a big issue of debate today is whether or not companies should even provide more information about their sustainability. And part of it is, people ask whether or not it's financially material that this information be provided. I know every company is different, but I'm wondering if you have a view on the materiality of sustainability.

Dimon: Yeah. Look, a lot of people tell me, ""You should disclose this. You should disclose that."" Even the smartest investors in the world. I tell them, ""We do. It's on page 247 of our 400-page 10K."" And then we send out a booklet on ESG, and we disclose a lot of various things we're doing and why we're doing it and how we're doing it. So again, I'm not against it, but if you start supplying templates and then there's litigation around it, and then people on the outside say, ""It's got to be audited by outside people."" That's all BS, and it won't accomplish the goal.

So we want to help accomplish the real goal. We want to do it intelligently. We're going to report stuff. And eventually we're going to support, when we think that's a good template to report. And then also support that that should be done broadly. Remember, there are private markets, there are public markets; $1 trillion of credit is supplied outside of the banking system. The banking system itself is getting smaller and smaller and smaller as part of the whole financial system. So if you're a regulator or government, you better be looking at the whole thing, not just the banks.

Pan: No, good point. So I want to shift gears a bit, because I think one thing that really makes it exciting to have you with us is obviously people know you by reputation. It's not an exaggeration to say that you're one of the most successful business leaders in America. And you've led, obviously [are] leading, one of the foremost companies here in the United States. So I guess I'm curious, given the pandemic, has the pandemic changed how you view your job? And to that, can you speak a little bit about how you think JPMorgan will be a different company once this pandemic is under control?

Dimon: Yeah, so it didn't change my job. We're not going to be a different company, but I do want to point out something that, it just heightened my sense about it. So COVID-19 and the murder of George Floyd highlighted for all of us something we already knew. One is that we've had racial inequality for a long time in spite of huge efforts to try to attack it. And the second is, COVID-19, we were completely unprepared for. I'm not blaming any administration, but if you look at some of these things, we have done policy really badly.

So it's heightened my sense of policy—and when I say policy, we're talking about infrastructure, education, immigration, regulation. When I say regulation, [I mean] red tape. I'm not talking about G-SIFI bank regulation. Healthcare, we have some of the best in the world, which I'm a beneficiary of, but we don't have better outcomes.

Obesity is a scourge. We don't teach K to 12 in certain schools. I mean, I can go on and on and on about our own shortcomings as a nation that I do think business, and that you saw after the murder of George Floyd, a lot of businesses said, ""Hey, we're going to double down. We have to get involved."" And so it is making me pound away at the point: we need collaboration between business, government and civic society. So we need good government. We need good regulatory guardrails. We need civic society, like unions and schools. But if we don't all work together to fix these problems, they won't be fixed. And we need analytical, detailed policymaking, like around climate, that can accomplish it.

But basically we've done a terrible job as a nation for 10, 20, 30 years, and it shows up. The Chinese think we're not competent anymore. And so it's time for us to kind of look inside, attack these things. And I think a lot of businesses are doing it. And maybe the pandemic accelerated that a little bit.

Pan: So you mentioned diversity and inclusion, especially in the context of what happened to George Floyd and how that affected this country. When you think about D&I, a lot of this goes to culture of organizations, our society, but of course from a policymaker perspective, there's a lot of interest to try to encourage more diversity and inclusion. So to what extent can policymakers affect culture? What can policymakers do to really get institutions and companies to do more about diversity and inclusion?

Dimon: Yeah. So remember as a policymaker, I'd look at the whole picture, and a lot of these companies already do a very good job at this stuff relative to others. There are whole industries that don't hire a lot of women and diverse candidates and Black and LGBT. So they should look at the full thing. And that's a really good question, because you kind of both want to incentivize it. You want to get it done properly. You want to have policies that help. And there are, but if I was a policymaker…and again, these companies are doing it, and I would support that. I think disclosing, like we have no problem having targets, none, because like we do in any other business, we have a target. And if you can't find a great Black person to hire, well, I'll take you to Howard University and show you one.

Now, we're teaching our people, be a little aggressive to meet targets. A lady who runs wealth management for us looked at and said, ""We don't have enough Black financial advisers."" We're going to do a program to hire and train 300. So we're going to attack, can the government do that? No, they can encourage it and push us a little bit. And of course when we testify, they're always going to ask us those things, which I think is completely fine and completely legitimate. But if I were them, I would look inside at the structural part that they'd been part of.

Our inner-city schools, which are poor, but there's all a huge amount of minorities involved in that, Black, Latinx, etcetera. Why have they been failing those kids? Why are these policies we've done not working? And so I can go policy by policy. And that's how I look at it. So I would support policies that accomplish the objectives, and the objectives can't just be...because you see our government throw more at failing schools. Well, that doesn't work. The goal isn't to get more money to failing schools. The goal is to get those kids graduated with a job.

There's a school right across the 59th Street Bridge here, which is mostly minority kids. They travel two, three, four hours a day [to] high school, but it's called the Aviation High School. They learn to maintain small aircraft, Cessna hydraulics, electrical systems, et cetera. And 95 percent of the kids graduate at $65,000-a-year salary. That's what we should be doing. So when we talk about schools, we should say that's how we're going to measure ourselves in the output, not the input. So I think there are tons of things policymakers could do, but they should. If I were them, I'd be really looking at infrastructure, educate, broadband in some of these areas that [don't] have it so that you're lifting up society, and it's kind of a sustainable permanent effort and you're not creating intergenerational poverty.

Pan: So I can't help but when you mention things like infrastructure, education spending, broadband…a lot of these issues are part of President Biden's proposal, his new infrastructure bill, right? As well as some other pieces of legislation he's put forward. So these are very large bills. A lot of money is part of these proposals. And the president has suggested that the way to fund the bills is through increasing taxes, higher corporate tax rate, a higher capital gains tax on wealthy families. So I sort of want to push you a bit to see, given that the priorities of President Biden's infrastructure bill would seem to go along the same lines that you were talking about before, are you concerned though about how he plans to finance this bill?

Dimon: Yeah. Yeah, I am. And I'm also concerned how the money's going to be spent. Again, our government doesn't do a great job at certain things and they should be very clear about what they want to accomplish. I've said, we all know Republicans want infrastructure too. I think it should be a bipartisan bill, but I think each piece and every piece should say, on highways, how many miles are you going to build? How much is it going to cost? When's it going to get done? Who's responsible?

On education, not just free community colleges, because we work with a lot of community colleges in the United States. How many kids are going to graduate? How many kids are going to have a job at $65,000 a year? So I worry about not just the bill, but we're just throwing money. It doesn't work. And we already waste tremendous sums of money. And I think we owe that to the American public, to tell the American public, ""If you're going to give me your money, I'm going to be a good steward of it. And here's what I'm going to accomplish. I'm going to report back to you."" Just like disclosures you're asking us to do, and a bunch of different things.

Then on the taxation side, first of all, they're completely unrelated. We should have proper infrastructure, proper immigration, proper healthcare, proper stuff. And then we should have proper corporate taxation, and obviously we got to pay for this stuff.

So I've always said we need competitive corporate taxation. I think the notion that you can have uncompetitive corporate taxes and you can be a competitive nation is a little crazy. I don't want to bore people with it. And by way, the devil's in the detail, which is it's not the 25 percent can you support, it's the other stuff: territorial, guilty chart things, deductions overseas, gap taxes. That's the stuff that, what they have currently, they wouldn't just be taking away the Trump corporate tax cut, they'd be tripling it literally. And that will really hurt capital formation in the United States. And capital formation drives all productivity, all technology, all growth. And if the policymakers don't get that and they think they're going to drive a lot of capital overseas, I think they're making a mistake.

On the individual side, I think the rich are going to have to pay more. Again, I think that you can't have capital gains at 39 whatever percent. I don't think it will be very successful. But again, I look at the seriousness. If you have carried interest, you're not being serious. If you're going to get rid of SALT, you're not being serious. There are tax benefits for sugar, cotton, corn, race cars, golf courses, and people think….So, I think we need demonstrate we're serious about how we're going to spend your money. And then you probably won't mind paying less. A lot of wealthy people, if they thought they were really lifting up those poor kids in the South Bronx they'd be willing to pay more. But most people don't think shipping money to DC is going to be productive. So, you got to earn that a little bit.

And so, I got an email from someone today saying government is good at doing bad things, but it's really bad at doing good things. So government, I think when they pass these bills and stuff, they should have accountability, responsibility, expected outcomes, and then measure it and tell us about it. And they should be doing that everywhere. Every department should be doing a report, what we do with your money.

Pan: You mentioned capital formation and also the power of markets, and earlier you talked a bit about private versus public markets. I wanted to touch on that because here at the Investment Company Institute, we're in the regulated fund industry. Something that you have talked about in the past has been the fact that retail investors are losing out of some investment opportunities because companies are going public a lot later in their lifecycle, and of course retail investors don't have the same access to a lot of these new startup opportunities. They're staying in the private markets a lot longer. And of course for us, mutual funds, then, are also losing out on those opportunities. I wondered if you could speak more about that—if you think it's a real problem. And if so, what do you think we can do about that?

Dimon: Yeah, I do think it's a real problem. And I know you can argue to make some of these vehicles accessible to retail investors. That's fine. That's a Band-Aid. I think you've got to ask yourself: what is the problem? And I'm going to lay out what I think might be a problem. I think if I was the regulators today, I think they have to become far more forward-looking than backward-looking. But we've gone from like 8,000 public companies to like 4,000. Now we're back up a little bit because of SPACs, and actually I'm not sure that was the best way to go about it. And you kind of ask the question: why? People are staying private much longer; they get private capital longer. Private equity now has $8 trillion of assets. Hedge funds have $2 trillion or $3 trillion of assets. But the reasons may be the wrong reason that if you're public: litigation, disclosures, which are capricious and expensive and a waste of time. Shareholder meetings—which, people laugh, they go to it and they think it's like a show. Most shareholders don't go there because there's nothing that the shareholder really wants to hear. And special interest groups who hijack the meetings or people who have cookie-cutter voting on every issue under the sun, from chairman CEO to comp to stuff like that.

And so, a private company can pay the people what it wants. The board focuses on the business. They don't have the press, they don't have the litigation, they don't have the costly regulations. But is that what you wanted? Is that what the regulators want? Do you want everyone to move? If I can make JPMorgan private, I'd make us private for all those reasons. So I think someone should analyze that, come to a determination what to do about it, not have a Band-Aid, say, ""OK, we'll allow private equity to sell to you in $1,000 pieces."" That's fine but it doesn't answer the question about why we...Is it a problem? Maybe you think it isn't. Maybe regulators and the government will come to the conclusion that it's better to have private capital markets, maybe. I don't personally think so, but maybe.

Pan: Right. And I haven't heard any regulator make that case yet, but maybe—

Dimon: Can I make one point about regulators, too, by the way? They should be looking at cryptocurrencies, payment for order flow, high-frequency trading, digital currencies, private markets versus public markets. Meanwhile, we're still doing Dodd-Frank from 10 years ago. I mean, what are we doing?

Pan: Well actually, I had a question on that because in your recent letter to shareholders, you actually spoke a bit about regulation, and especially as it may have applied to liquidity stress that we saw last March, just right when the pandemic was starting. Now, in your letter—you wrote that the confluence of three main constraints, and you're referring to the liquidity coverage ratio rule, the supplementary leverage ratio rule, and G-SIFI capital rules—that these constraints created red lines that we cannot cross. And this has the effect of preventing not only JPMorgan, but also other institutions affected by these rules, that you can't intermediate market stress the way you used to be able to. Now, I think the events of last March showed that markets can lock up, especially if you have these large external shocks. So, why do you think regulators struggle with acknowledging that the regulations may actually have a constraining effect on the ability of banks like yourself to intermediate the markets?

Dimon: The broader thing in that letter, I talk about, I think people should do things with the forethought. And so, after Dodd-Frank, and I wasn't against Dodd-Frank. It accomplished its main objectives, by the way, which was more liquidity, more capital, resolution. Lehman wouldn't have happened; AIG wouldn't have happened, Fannie. A lot of these things simply wouldn't have happened, or if they happened, it would've been an orderly process to clean them up, as opposed to what we have was a very disorderly one. So, I'm not arguing that, but I'm making a point that we have a huge growth in private credit markets, huge growth in private equity, huge growth in fintech. A lot of these fintech companies are now bigger than banks. PayPal is bigger than every bank in the world other than JPMorgan. The whole banking system in Europe is worth a trillion dollars, what it was worth 20 years ago, so the banking system…

If that's what they wanted, fine, but I don't think it was. And part of what we, one of the mistakes we made is we have so many people involved in simple regulations, like mortgage, derivatives, that everyone's got, and they're all independent agencies, so it's very hard for them to decide. So they’re still, literally, we're still getting rules on bail-in-able debt, how we can pay dividends, how stress tests. And that's 10 years later, so it's a very backward-looking process. I think it becomes very political because so many people are involved, so it's hard for them to say yeah, we made a mistake. Too much of it is public.

You were a regulator. You have the right to say, ""Jamie, you’re…"" At the end of the day, I salute my regulators. I'm going to do whatever they want. They're my judge, my jury, my hangman, but it's hard for them to have a conversation. And it kind of gets down to the lowest common denominator about what you want us to do and stuff like that on this particular item, and you’ve got to be very clear. When things are really, really bad, the Fed will have to come in and intermediate like they did in ‘08, like they did in the Depression, like they did in this time. But there were times where they shouldn't be the only one who intermediates. So, here's JPMorgan. In those months, we had a trillion dollars of cash, basically cash and liquid securities.

But because of the confines of those three things, we could have put—and I know the money market funds needed like $150 billion—JPMorgan alone could have financed the whole $150 billion, all of it with the trillion, with all the liquidity, all the capital, not taking any additional real risk, being paid, proper clout. But it would have sucked out LCR. We've been below the hundred. The G-SIFI scores would have gone way up. Well OK, if that's what they wanted, fine. If that's what they wanted, they're the only ones who intermediate. And again, I'm not worried about when things are really bad, but there are just fluctuations that they have to step in. They're stepping in now in the repo markets. Is that what they wanted? That they have to be the only game in town, whereas we, in the great financial recession, we financed a lot of people out there. We financed people with Brazilian bonds and these things—60 percent leverage, not 95. Diversified portfolios of bonds, we completely understood. We held the collateral. But it gave the funds a chance to orderly liquidate, as opposed to just [having] to dump securities in the market.

And we've seen that in the repo markets; you see that in the credit markets. And I just think it was a mistake. And again, I think some of these things should have been private. So even the discount window—which, by the way, is a form of how you provide credit in the marketplace, that’s got this, if you use it, you're a bank that's in trouble, which is just obviously not true. And so we've changed the whole banking system. And I still don't know, some for better, some for worse, but I don't know what the net aggregate is. We'll find out down the road.

Pan: I wanted to ask you about China, because this of course is—

Dimon: But meanwhile, I'm shocked. I mean, if you look at the growing issues—someone should be saying, what do we want to do around crypto? So I'm not a fan of Bitcoin, but forget whether I am or not. There should be legal, regulatory, tax-related framework, AML around crypto. It's now worth $2 trillion. When are they going to say, ""Oh my God, this is worthy of our attention?"" And of course, you've seen stuff about paying for it....There are tons of issues that they...exchanges, off-market exchanges. Data brokers, data privacy, data localization—the future issues. Cyber. That's what they really should be paying attention to.

Pan: So that's interesting, because on cryptocurrencies, why do you think they've been slow to react to cryptocurrencies? Is it a lack of understanding? Is it a case of the generals fighting the last war? Do you have a theory?

Dimon: Yeah, it's generals fighting the last war. And then early on in the Obama administration, there was the love of technology and it was a new thing, and…everyone wanted to look like they are supporting the new technologies. Well, now it's big. And it deserves a certain amount of attention, and how it gets used, and why it gets used. And is it following the laws of the land? I just, they're distracted. They've got big jobs. And we're still looking backwards, fixing Dodd-Frank. So it's a combination of all those things, but if I were them, I'd be paying a little attention. Because when it's $3 trillion, then $4 trillion, then $5 trillion, when grandmas start buying it and people start being ripped off and ransomware's going into a hundred cities, not 30, I think you're going to have an uproar about what was allowed to happen.

Pan: Right.

Dimon: Right.

Pan: Well, before...because our time is limited, I did want to ask you a bit about China. Because honestly, the US–China relationship is having a large impact on the global financial system, on our global trading system. And you have commented on the United States needs to mature the management of this relationship. I was hoping you could share with us your views on, do you have concerns with current tensions between the United States and China? And is there a different approach, or how would you advise the Biden administration as to how to work with China?

Dimon: Yeah. So I think they're doing the right thing, which is try to...The Trump administration pointed out some real problems that the business community and government should have focused on a long time ago. We all didn't. You could point fingers at people and some senators, bank business, and all that, but the American public should look at the big picture, OK? China's done a great job developing itself, its own way, different than we would have done it. They've gone from 400 per person GDP to 10,000. We're 65,000 per person. Even in 20 years, they'll be at 60 and we'll be 85 or 90. They have real issues which their authorities know about: food, water, energy, corruption, lack of transparency, rule of law. And they're making real progress in all of that. And it's not against us. They also have a very complicated geopolitical situation, far more than ours. We've got Canada and Mexico, our wonderful neighbors. The Atlantic and the Pacific.

They have the Philippines, the Koreas, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan, India, Russia. It's a complex part of the world. And now we've got conflicts. All the trader issues, of course people are worried about Taiwan and they're worried about the democracy, what they've done in Hong Kong, and the Uyghurs, all legitimate things. But at the end of the day, I think the administration privately...I think insulting each other publicly is just a bad idea. It kind of rouses that nationalistic stuff in both countries. And that can force politicians to push people to do bad things.

Have a real conversation about trade. I think in trade, we should work with the allies, kind of lay out what we want to do, and let them join, if they do it the way we think is appropriate. Not against them, just lay it out. And I think that'll lead to a little bit of a decoupling. Not a total percent, just a restructure, which is a lot of what has already happened already. And then I think we've got to be very cautious on military, geopolitical, stuff like that. And they should talk to each other. We had a lot of cultural exchanges taking place, which I am generally for, but I think and then we have common interests. Neither of us, I think, want a lot of nuclear proliferation. I mean, that would be bad for everybody. Neither of us like terrorism, neither of us...Both countries think climate is a real issue that's got to be faced. So we know we could create common interest, too, and then have those very private conversations.

And I think the Biden administration is doing what most of us expected. Kind of more traditional, but not easier on the Chinese, but more traditional diplomacy and trying to have the conversation. And anyone who has been as—and I'm not an expert in foreign policy—but all the people who've been involved in this a long time, who I do speak to, Bob Gates and Henry Kissinger, think that you got to go back to a deep, detailed, strategic dialogue so there are no misunderstandings and you can accomplish some good things together.

Pan: Well, I wish we could spend a lot more time with you. I really want to thank you again for being here today. You've given us a lot to think about. And we very much appreciate all the insight that you've provided. So thank you.

Dimon: Thank you very much. And everybody, thank you very much for spending time with me. Keep the faith, good luck, and hopefully next year [we will be] in person.

Pan: Definitely. Take care.

All right, great. Thanks everybody for joining. We're really happy to have JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon return again to the conference. Jamie, thanks so much for joining us today.

Jamie Dimon

Thrilled to be here. Thank you.

Unidentified Analyst

So, you hosted an Investor Day last week for your investors and analysts. A lot of journalists in the audience today probably didn't get a chance to listen in. Maybe you could take a few minutes to summarize the key takeaways that you and your team and your team wanted to convey at your Investor Day, last week.

Jamie Dimon

Yes, so we did have Investor Day. It was long; it went from like 8:00 to 3:00 o'clock. All the major executives made presentations, including one on tech, one on CCB, CIB, asset wealth management, payments, markets, et cetera. And the point was is that we really hadn't spoken to investors in detail for two years. So, some had a compliant that we're spending a lot of money, a lot of issues out there, we've done a bunch of acquisitions; and they were right. So, we took to time to explain it in detail about why we're spending $6 billion more in 2022 versus 2021, how we look at investments.

And there was a lot of detail in that, like how we look at application investments, how we look at acquisition investments, how we look at new branches and bankers, and hardware and software, and modernization and all that. So, you got to go through the detail, but that's how you have to run a business, is at a very detailed level. We gave some updates of things which don't surprise people very much of NAI as -- for this year, and kind of a first view, but kind of benchmark for maybe next year. And we spoke -- obviously spoke about the economy and stuff like that. I really think it's a great chance for you all to see our senior management team in person, answering questions, up on stage, explaining their business, why they're doing what they're doing, a couple of things are different, a couple of things are not completely normal.

And we didn't describe everything. I think sometimes we describe too much and give away too many things that help our -- help investors [technical difficulty] I went to Fidelity, and Wellington, and [technical difficulty] I went up to Boston, did a kind of Boston tour, and [some people] [Ph] were asking some really great questions, which were exactly the ones we didn't want to answer, and -- because we're not going to. But there's -- there's other great stuff we're doing. We're quite comfortable with the company, and we're quite comfortable with how we make these investments and such. So, I'm -- yes.

Question-and-Answer Session

Q - Unidentified Analyst

Yes. I mean, traditionally, JPMorgan has been a stock for all seasons, it's done well in good markets and tough markets, and particularly in down markets, you've been defensive. Do you think the characteristics of what's built the company historically, and the balance sheet, and the diversity are still true today, and could make it perform well on a tough day?

Jamie Dimon

Totally. I mean, what protects a company in a downturn is, firstly, you're prepared. But we're only talking about through the cycle. So, we acknowledge when we're over-earning on credit, and that that's going to normalize; we're quite clear about that. And that might be $3 billion of charges for a year. And we have to prepare for things like CECL and AOCI, and downturns, and all that. But your best preparation is [that fortress] [Ph] balance sheet, it's conservative accounting, we don't have a lot of - not a lot, we have almost no one-time gains or losses or MSR, even when you look at like MSR, that's conservative too because there's very little FHA services in there.

When things go bad FHA servicing is very expensive when the delinquencies hit 5% or 10%, which is guaranteed to happen in downturn. And the same with -- look at our real estate portfolio, it's mostly the ones you worry about are mostly Class A; fully leased up, no spec, you know, all these various things which is hard to look at, but that protection, when those margins, when things get bad, we'll still have the margins, we'll still be making money. And the reason we want to do that is so we can serve clients in the toughest of times, and we have plenty of capital, and plenty of balance sheet. There's a lot of capital uncertainty because we still don't know SEB, we don't know if there'll be any adjustments of G-SIFI, which we're not counting on. We did some acquisitions which took away from some buyback capability. Though, I much prefer to do really smart acquisitions and stock buyback. You may not like that so much sometimes because you want our consistency, and all that. But -- so, yes, we'll be a [fortress] [Ph] balance sheet in the next go-around too. And we're quite concerned about the environment. So, I try to separate, if you ask me, what it -- right now, if you have a benign environment, like you all have forecast, which in our forecast; that's your forecast it's a benign environment.

I don't know what it's going to be like by the end of the year. I'm prepared for a non-benign environment by the end of the year. So, to me it's -- we try to explain all that as best we can, and I think it's important we do that. But we will be prepared for bad outcomes.

Unidentified Analyst

And on that front, what degree of difficulty do you attach to the task at hand in front of the Fed right now? And you mentioned storm clouds.

Jamie Dimon

Yes.

Unidentified Analyst

Maybe you could talk about --

Jamie Dimon

I'm going to change the storm cloud because I said there were three things that we're going through, which are, I hate the word unprecedented, which are kind of unprecedented. And you got to put this in the back of your mind, when you haven't -- when you're seen things that have never happened before, then you have to question your ability to predict, okay. One is huge growth in this country driven by fiscal and monetary stimulation. That isn't a normal recovery, okay, and that fiscal stimulation is still in the pocketbooks of consumers, they're spending it, they're spending at very strong levels. And the data is completely distorted. It's distorted by inflation, it's distorted by -- they went from goods back to services, it's distorted by all these things; but jobs are plentiful, wages are going up, consumers are spending, the lower-income folks, not quite as much as before, but everybody else it looks like they have $2 trillion dollars more, savings rate drop. I don't think that's going to stop their spending the six or nine months. And so, that to me is the bright clouds out there or -- but it's different. The Fed has to meet this now with raising rates and QT. And the new part of this isn't the raising rates, it's the QT. The QT has -- we've never had QE before like this.

Therefore, we've never had QT like this. So, you're looking at something they could be writing in the history books on for 50 years; what was QE, what worked, what didn't work? I think a lot of parts of QE backfired. I think the negative rates was probably a huge mistake for a whole bunch of different reasons I won't bore you with now. But they got to raise rates, and mind you, they have to do QT. They do not have a choice because there's so much liquidity in the system; they have to remove some of the liquidity to stop the speculation, to reduce home prices, stuff like that. And you've never been through QT, so, all the major buyer -- if you -- look, if you go back to 2010 and say, ""Who are all the major buyers of treasures?""

All that time it was central banks, foreign exchange managers, banks who were topping up their liquidity profiles, because we had to for regulations. All three, it's -- it won't happen, the go-around. Banks are topped up, foreign exchange managers are topped up, the central bank would be selling, not buying, and governments have much for fiscal deficit to finance. That's a huge change in the flow of funds around the world. I don't know what the effect of that is. I'm prepared for -- and you're talking about minimum huge volatility. And the third thing is Ukraine; that you've not had a European land war since 1945, okay. And you -- and the complexity of Ukraine is we don't know the outcome.

I always make a list, you know, you predict the outcome. Well, you couldn't predict the outcome of Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, Iraq, and 10 other conflagrations; all wrong. Wars go bad. They go south, they have unintended consequences. And this happens to be really in the commodity markets of the world; wheat, oil, gas, and stuff like that which, in my view, will continue. We're not taking the proper actions to protect Europe from what's going to happen in oil in the short-run, and we're not taking the proper actions to protect you all what's going to oil in the next five years, which means it almost has to go up the price. We're not investing enough money to keep oil -- remember, and for all those who love climate change, if oil prices go to $175 or $150, which I kind of think is in the cards, to tell you the truth.

You know, not in the immediate run, but down the road, then CO2 won't go down, which is everyone predicts because people buy less oil and gas. It's going to go up because all those other countries out there, the poor countries who need oil and gas to feed and heat their citizens, will turn off -- will not buy oil and gas, they'll buy coal, that's what's going to happen. CO2 will go up, it's won't come down. And we're not dealing with these challenges. So, those three things; fiscally induced growth, QT, Ukraine war, so I'm going to change the storm clouds out there because I -- look, I'm an optimist. I said there's storm clouds, they're big storm clouds, they're -- it's a hurricane.

It's, we -- right now it's kind of sunny, things are doing fine, everyone thinks the Fed can handle this. That hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way. We just don't know if it's a minor one or Superstorm Sandy or -- yes, Sandy or Andrew, or something like that. And it's -- see, you better brace yourself. So, JPMorgan is bracing ourselves, and we're going to be very conservative in our balance sheet. And with all this capital uncertainty, we're going to have to take actions. And I kind of want to shed non-operating deposits again, which we can do in size to protect ourselves so we could serve clients in bad times. And so, that's the environment we're dealing with. And I'm -- I think it's okay to hope that it will all end up okay; I hope it, that's my goldilocks, I hope, who the hell knows.

Unidentified Analyst

What do you think it means for the potential credit cycle that might ensue, and the preparedness of the banking industry?

Jamie Dimon

It's -- the banking industry is in great shape, and the credit cycles follow a norm, okay. And even in the Great Financial Recession, it followed a norm, with a couple of little exceptions; mortgage, it was a trillion dollars actually to be lost. You -- we all woke up some time in '08 or '09 and said, ""My god, it's a trillion dollars,"" and it was everywhere. It wasn't derivatives. It was in CLOs, it was in banks, it was in insurance companies, it was -- but that caused panic because people woke up, and investors, and they said, ""My god, it's everywhere."" What do you do? You sell. You know, so there's panic-selling and stuff like that.

And I think you may see that again, by the way, too, because I -- I don't think the bank could intermediate in the markets that we're used to. So, when all this liquidity gets rundown, yes, we're going to hit wall. And then when that wall gets hit in terms of intermediation, you're going to see very volatile market again. And no one is going to be able to step in, other than the Fed, which maybe they can't do this time. So -- but the credit cycle follows a norm, normally. And that's the minimum you should expect. And we've shown people credit card -- I mean it's at all-time lows today, but in the Great Recession it had peaked at 10%. We would have told you before that 8%; we were off by not that much.

What surprises people is it won't be mortgage this time. It won't be -- we don't see it, there might be something in the private credit markets, you had, okay it goes. I mean, when things happen it will -- someone will get hurt somewhere. And sometimes it's industries you just least expect. And so you have to be very careful in that, like in the '00s it was telecom and utilities, the ones that were the most stable. You know, in '07-'08 it was Warren Buffet and newspapers. I mean, so there's underlying changes in credit, you have to be very careful about, very hard to spot. And therefore, the discipline is you never put all your eggs in one basket. You're very careful, and no matter how people think real estate or there's something like that.

And so, anyway, you have a normal credit cycle, charge-offs will go up, we'll still be earning money; CECL makes it very volatile. Like, I think I pointed out in Investor Day; we put up, in two quarters, so in the first quarter of 2020, the second quarter $15 billion of CECL. And then the next four quarters, we took it down. I mean, I don't know what kind of accounting that is, I think it's crazy. I don't know who invents this shit, but we have to deal with it regardless.

Unidentified Analyst

There's been a big expansion of credit outside the banking system, you know of reference that. Is that a concern in your mind, in terms of the -- [multiple speakers]…

Jamie Dimon

It's hard to tell. This is the private -- I mean I -- look, I think some of these direct lenders are very smart people. And you had Blackstone here, you have Ares, and Oak; they're all very smart. It's huge numbers now. The issue for the world is that those borrowers may be stranded when the shit hits the fan, because these people cannot rollover that credit at 13% and 14% -- they're going to have to charge 13% or 14%. And so, they're going to call up JPMorgan and say, ""What do you -- would you -- will you have us back?"" And we're going -- in some cases we're going to say no, because we'll have tapped out what we could do too because we also hit our own redlines, and stuff like that.

So, is that systemic? I don't know; there's a lot of leverage lending out there. Will someone get hurt? Probably. Will that credit dry up in that segment of the market? Probably. There are other things we see out there that are particularly bad. No, but we have to still report we have called shadow banking. And we put it all together from repo to money market funds to commercial paper to CLOs to mortgage banking. The mortgage businesses have moved away from banks for good reason. The capital and liquidity requirements are so high that a bank, it really doesn't belong in banks anymore. And will be able to make mortgages when the shit hits fan? Maybe not. Even today if you look at private label mortgages, they are 50 to 75 basis points higher than what retail banks are doing. And the only way the other folks can finance it is by securitizations. I don't why a retail bank is issuing something at 4.25 when you can buy in the marketplace at 5? You have to question that logic a little bit. And so, you are going to see this stuff is going to get worse if the markets get tighter and liquidity dries up a little bit. We will be prepared for. And so, should you if you are smart.

Unidentified Analyst

Talk about some of the industry issues that you are dealing with. In terms of expense pressures, how much of the inflation burden are banks likely to see? And where are you seeing that now?

Jamie Dimon

It's no different than everywhere. I mean you see it every day now, like but this when we told you all numbers, we kind of embedded that in. I don't know what other people did when they told you their numbers. We were embedding and you can embed in your own number 4%, 5%, but it's relentless. And so, you are going to see a lot of people making adjustments. And by the way, I want to keep our best people. So, like, we have to pay well to keep our best people. We're quite religious about that. It will be what it is. Remember there are benefit from inflation too like NII is going to be much higher. And it's not a one thing. But, you are going to see it. And I think you will see a lot of banks, tech companies -- I think a lot of companies are facing it.

Unidentified Analyst

Yes.

Jamie Dimon

But you -- when you guys do your own estimates for 2023, you should tell me what you think it should be because I could be thinking 5%. You are thinking 2%. Or, you are thinking 2% -- I am thinking 2 and you are thinking 5. And it will be what it is at that point. We will do it intelligently. We will manage our expenses like we always have.

Unidentified Analyst

And for banks--

Jamie Dimon

In 2023, remember, if you have a -- if a severe recession starts sometime in 2023, wage inflation can go to zero like literally overnight.

Unidentified Analyst

Okay. And how about capital? There is capital pressures are growing on yourself and other banks from a combination of the macro environment and also the regulatory rules. How does that influence --

Jamie Dimon

It's mostly accounting rules, AOCI and CSOL, and yes, it will conscript -- we do a little bit. And G-SIFI and you got to project forward and all that, so --

Unidentified Analyst

How does that affect your plans for growth and how you allocate capital?

Jamie Dimon

It doesn't affect our plans for growth in terms of growing our company or investments we are making. It will affect how we deal with non-operating deposits, what we put on balance sheet or not, what we sell or not. We could be much more aggressive about what's on the balance sheet and what's not. There are lot of things we simply don't have to keep or don't have to do somewhere to facilitate markets, somewhere to help clients. And so, if we have to, we will tighten that up to. And we're probably going to.

Unidentified Analyst

Earlier in the year, you laid out a medium-term ROTCE target of 17% at the Investor Day.

Jamie Dimon

It was never a medium-term target. That is what we expect to earn through the cycle. I am getting rid of -- I don't know what medium term means. I remember when I first got to Bank One -- no, JP Morgan, I said we aspire -- maybe it was Bank One. We aspire to earn 15% in tangible equity. And inside the company, it was like aspiration. People thought I didn't mean it. So, I eventually said, no, that's your freaking target buddy. That's what you got to earn. Like that's what you should be earning. Let's not pretend. So, we said 17% is what we expect to earn through cycle and we have. But the way I look at it through the cycle.

So, this cycle we are under earning NII. We are over earning in credit. We've still got 17% last year and we are better. I don't really include [SeaStone] [Ph] there because that just swings around just too much. But I obviously include charge-offs and stuff like that. And next year, NII is going to be a nice kick for us. And expenses are going up a bit and all that. So, it's still 17. If you have recession, it will be 17. It will be something lower like that's life. And I also told our CFO, Jeremy Barnum to do a little calculation. Anyone has a 12c in front of you? HP 12c, whatever it is? Do the calculation that JP Morgan earn 17% in capital and grows at 7% a year for how many years it will take before 50% of the GDP of the United States of America? I mean I would take 17% all day long. Okay, that's pretty good. You all don't earn 17% of your capital.

Unidentified Analyst

One of the drivers this year is loan growth. And you are looking for loan growth to be kind of growing in high single digits. How broad based is that? And then, how does the hurricane kind of factor into that?

Jamie Dimon

Again you have to separate the hurricane from running the business day to day. And that hurricane is making us be careful how we are running the business day to day. Loan growth is an output. If you run a bank and you think a lot of loans, you do not want loans. A lot of loans have a suboptimal return. If I generate a loan and I put it on my balance sheet which you can buy the same loan in the market, okay, without any overhead, why would I have 240,000 people doing at a year? Why won't I just have no people and buy the loan. It's called the fun. And so, the reason you do a loan is because you are building a business that for every loan -- and for the most parts loans are priced at the market. And of course with regulations -- and one day I am going to show you a chart, if I have to hold twice as much capital with somebody else that somebody else should own the loan.

Now I am not going to be able to do it overnight. Damn sure I am going to do it over time. Why we own loans that you couldn't hold much more profitably than me. And so, to me it's going to -- you got to recycle your capital. It happens in some markets and not in others. But loan growth is an outcome. If you don't have the whole business, you wouldn't probably be in the business at all. And the whole business -- if you think of the subscription business, cash management, custody, other flows, feed businesses, the relationship. So, one of the benefits at JP Morgan, we make it -- why we are doing unitranche lending now like in unitranche lending there are bigger loans. They are priced better than our term A, term B, and sub, and all stuff like that.

You can pay more per dollar risk. But that's all they get. And then, people invest in that. We get that plus also the stuff. That's why we do it. I wouldn't do it just to get that. And so, we got to be very careful when you bank about why you bank at all, and so, launch you an outcome of – and obviously outcome of growth and the economy and all that. So, we see a lot of today middle market companies are taking -- they kept the revolvers. They need more to finance inventory, the receivables, and CapEx, which seems to going up in whole bunch of different places. So, it looks like now I got a pretty decent loan growth this year. We may very well reduce what we hold on the balance sheet, which is a different issue. That's more of a best execution you should ask for managing the balance sheet. But the loan growth itself it looks to be pretty robust right now.

Unidentified Analyst

How about the demand on the consumer side? Are they revolving a little bit more on cards? And what are you seeing in terms of consumer demand and -- [multiple speakers]…

Jamie Dimon

I got to say I haven't looked at it since Investor Day. Surely want to update that. But I have been clear from then I expect that to happen. You can guess when it's going to happen. But, it's like given. And you already see it in subprime. So, my guess is it will happen probably a little bit later. But it's the same basic thing.

Unidentified Analyst

You mentioned managing the operating deposit.

Jamie Dimon

Also Marianne always points out that you got to look at two things. Well NII went down because revolver went down. Charge-offs went way down because revolver went down. So, they had some relation between the two.

Unidentified Analyst

In terms of industry deposits, do you expect deposits to leave the banking system as QT gets going? And you mentioned [indiscernible] --

Jamie Dimon

I want to push it now. I mean I am on the other side of this one. I want to -- we have a lot of nonrecurring deposits. We keep as a service declines. I don't know. I mean I -- but the issue for the industry is what happens when they reverse QT. And what does come out of first. And we don't really know. I guess we never had QT. If I had to tell you my current thinking at first you are going to see a reduction in money market funds kind of wholesale related deposits, the Fed RRP facility is now in astounding $2 trillion, but eventually you're going to see it filter into consumer because when we had QE, if I remember correctly, and actually we should get this data could we did some real work way back when that first QE showed up in wholesale deposits, but eventually morphed into consumer deposits. And so, you can see that, so we again, we have to be prepared for both, like what's, where's the runoff going to be? So, we -- I think Jeremy gave you guys a number about the expected deposit growth with all of our assumptions, and that number is probably still pretty good. And I gave that could be plus or minus $300 billion or $400 billion, but again, it's $400 billion, and it comes out of non-operating deposits, it doesn't really mean that much to us.

Unidentified Analyst

And maybe you could talk a little bit to these folks here today about the investment agenda that you laid out at the Investor Day, just think you've got a leadership position most of your businesses. So, where are the opportunities you see that are not there?

Jamie Dimon

But the team showed, which I think is really important, not just where we're a leader, but where we're not like, you could be number one in fixed income trading, but we know we're number four in Asia, we're number seven in this country, we're number 10 in FX in this country, we're number. So, if you look at all the weak spots where we don't have big shares, we don't know, like even our Chase Wealth Management, because Jen and Marianne showed, the huge growth opportunity, but we have like a 1.5% share from $100,000 to $5 million of assets under management, why not 10 and Jen mentioned that, I think so if you have a 20% share in deposits, until about 10 or 15 years from now, because that's almost every other country has that and as you add services and products, so but anyway, the way we look at branches, bankers, and these could be and we don't, we're not going to give you all the numbers, this is somewhere embedded in the presentations.

But opening a branch, we know exactly the profitability pretty much going to be down the road. And we've been positively surprised. And now we're in 48 states, hiring bankers and middle market or Chase Wealth Management bankers, we pretty much know what the outcome is going to be and we've been positively surprised. Marketing is, that go up or down. So, we sit here and marry into a number $7 billion in marketing. Now, another accounting ridiculous thing is a lot of the credit card business; it is expensed against NII in 12 months. So, you don't see it. The only you see, we tell you about that. But I mean, I don't know that doesn't seem to be matching revenues, expenses to me, just like CECL does, and AOCI does and banks like the industry, wherever the all the losses are upfront and everything else is on the come, and which hurts capital by the way, it hurts capital formation and banking which I again think is a minor mistake, but that that those numbers could, you could have a billion dollars of opportunity that gets very high returns, or can disappear right away.

And the other lesson, secret lesson is, sometimes when things get bad that marketing money is worth more, not less, because you get far more bang for the buck. So, you got to be a little careful. That's why I don't like making promises and expenses at all, we could spend $500 million more on marketing, credit card or marketing something like this, and the returns are extraordinary high, we're going to seize it, and then explain it to our shareholder, just like you would if you owned 100% of the company. And then, we went, the harder ones are in every business went through stuff, they're doing some of the tech and we gave it like very specific things, just some examples of AI. Okay, where we know we're spending, we didn't tell you how much we're spending, but there's a billion dollars of identifiable benefit we gave one, I'll give you one example on risk and fraud, or risk and fraud and the Consumer Bank is losses are coming down, while volumes over the years have doubled. And you all know, how much Ford is out there today. That's AI, a couple of examples like that.

And AI does things like hedging a lot of our equity portfolios today, which is astronomical in a way you couldn't do as a human being. And then, we gave specific examples on software, we're building that has identifiable returns, and some that doesn't really, some of the modernization stuff and data centers stuff, even like the data center stuff, we know when we move something new data center, that the operating costs for that application dropped 20% or 30%. And it becomes accessible to far more services. It's kind of invaluable. But so we try to give people a taste for all those things. And the $77 billion, about $50 billion, what we call it investments, and we try to have rigor around those.

Unidentified Analyst

And in terms of how the investment agenda gets set at JPMorgan, it's not Dimon said it's from the top down, right? It does come from the bottom up and people come to you with ideas.

Jamie Dimon

It's a little bit of both. So, and it should be like, so people, we ask them, what do you want to do? How do you want to do it? What are your opportunities and they that surfaces up, some things and we don't tend to if they're obvious, we tend to let them do it, okay, but there's certain things that have to be said at the top, modernization has got to be set at the top, certain things you know that we have to, like, I've been a lot of companies where operations is always under invested in because no one sets a budget for operations. If you have operations within the CIB or the company, the rebuild and fixing and technology it supports operations has got to be budgeted centrally, it was budgeted in front of office will always win. And the new data centers will never be built. So, the new data centers we top down, some of the modernization is top down, some of the other stuff that's in my view as Daniel Pinto in the CIB is top down, and then other stuff bubbles up is both.

Unidentified Analyst

So, from the outside, how should we gauge the success of the investments over time? I mean, just in terms of how it plays to your operating metrics ROE?

Jamie Dimon

I mean we try to show you the tons of examples that should give you comfort, how we go about it. But the end of the day, do we earn 70% on tangible equity through the cycle and do we grow? Do we compete, because it's very easy not to grow, it's very easy not to invest in your future and have higher margins. I also think I've always been opposed this concept of ever increasing margins. I don't know what people are thinking, we live in a capitalist world. So, when people I remember that when Citi was under all that, they're constantly increasing their margins, and they're showing the increase in operating leverage. Well, what do you increase operating leverage to, Jeff Bezos says, your margin is my opportunity. So, we take very often we're giving the customer a better deal. That's what we do. It's called capitalism, you will do it required to think that you can honestly always increase your margins as a mistake, as long as you're building a great company with great returns, great customer results, good growth and stuff like that, you should be happy with your company.

Unidentified Analyst

In addition to the organic investments?

Jamie Dimon

But the other thing to keep in mind is, if we don't think this stuff is working, we can cancel it. But not like the Federal government who started a program that doesn't work as they are 30 years later, we can cancel it. And we can apply rigor, looking backwards about some of the stuff we did or didn't work or did work.

Unidentified Analyst

You've been using fill in bolt-on M&A a little bit more in the past couple of years, in addition to the organic investments, well, what's the change that led to that?

Jamie Dimon

Well, I think for a long time, we wouldn't have been allowed to do acquisitions for a whole bunch of different reasons. And the other thing, which I think is very important, I think every company should, I grew up in an environment where every time a business wasn't doing well. At the management meeting, you quickly start bullshitting about M&A? Well, we need to have size and scope. I think every business should have your own plan, how you can build it, how are you going to compete organically and organic growth is the hardest growth.

Adding Salesforce is hard, adding research is hard, adding branches is hard, and you can't turn them on and turn them off. And so, I always tell people, no, you have a job organic growth. That's a huge discipline at Bankers and clients and services and products. And it's the best growth, it's your culture. It's consistent. It's you know what it is? It's like our opening branch didn't like, Doug Petno showed a chart since WAMU. Where do we open we're now in all 75, I think also the five major cities. We were in 25 of them. We started before WAMU, getting him to open in every and getting him he wanted to do but to open it every place to hire bankers, to add the credit officers, to add the Treasury services, product managers. It's a lot of work.

But it's great work because the returns are enormous. And I could have bought we were, we couldn't buy another bank, but acquisition is also very hard. They shouldn't detract more. So, years ago, I was told you all we want to I'd rather invest in our own business organically, M&A after a dividend and then buyback. And so, I think acquisition opportunities opened up and we started to take them, I want them as we can be looking, and they're disciplined enough that they can grow organically and look, as opposed to it distracts, sometimes it does distract you from growing organically. When you do a big acquisition you're also on all your teams are focused on consolidating and putting things together and management team and it kind of innovation and organic growth drops by the wayside, doesn't have to but it often does.

Unidentified Analyst

Is there any kind of common denominator or thread of the type of things you'll do in organically versus build?

Jamie Dimon

No, in asset management, you don't understand this, we bought a company that manages Timberland, we bought a company that does tax, it takes single accounts, MSAs and does tax advantaged investing, so it automatically adjusts for an company that does ESG, open events where you can basically say I liked this index, but I want to over index the boards that have more women on the more that have do a better job on scoring on this climate score ESG, so you can run a portfolio and then direct it the way you want, in payments we got to look at Aviva, its capabilities is extraordinary.

So, it's just kind of a fabulous add on for us. And in a little bit, the one was a little bit different is the stuff we did in travel, cxLoyalty awards company and frosh, a travel agents. But it's fabulous stop and we expect it all to pay back and in pay back and defend the business, it will also defend the business. So, we have to execute. But the fact is, I think it was a fabulous strategy. And I congratulate them for even coming up with all of that. And we've got some very competitive folks there who want to win big time in travel.

The other amazing thing and we, I always say, is there a reason you win, one quarter of all U.S. travel goes through our credit card. That's a huge number. And only a portion of that goes through our own travel related stuff. And if we can increase that portion even a little bit, it's fabulous for the client, it is fabulous for the company, and it's hugely competitive, and offensive and defensive.

Unidentified Analyst

In terms of the competitive environment, and as long as I've been doing this, you've always said, as a financial institution, there's competition everywhere from every angle always, but with the rise of Fintechs and maybe big tech, looking at financial services as the nature or intensity of competition change in recent years?

Jamie Dimon

Well, I think in the recent months has come down a little bit, look I think there's going to be a lot of winners and losers in this and what I've tried to point out is that 20 years ago, if I was sitting here, our competition was mostly other banks around the world, U.S. around the world, stuff like that. And now you have very intense shadow banks, think of Citadel, the mortgage brokers, direct lenders, a lot of payments companies, exchanges, data companies, but they're skimming off a lot of profit from the financial system. And then, you have Fintech. And they're good ones, and not but Stripe and PayPal, and IDN and Square, and they're all doing interesting stuff.

And then, you got big tech. So, big tech, you've all seen Apple has made their announcements about they want to do P2P, they've already got the Apple wallet, they want to give you some kind of credit journey experience, they're going to do merchant processing, they're going to do merchant lending, and may not be their own balance sheet. But that's a bank. That's a bank, may not have insured deposits, but it's a bank, if you move money, hold money, manage money, lend money, that's the bank. And then, everyone's going to try to embed payment systems in their ecosystem just makes sense. It could be as a bank, it could be white labeled, it could be, which we're not going to do but your soul will do it or it could be they'll give you a marketplace. So, there's a lot of I think there's a lot of competition coming. And the reason I talk about is not I'm not afraid of it, I'm in favor of competition, and their strengths and weaknesses for banks. But you better not put your head in the sand. I mean, the worst thing a CEO can do at a company is, is have this A, B, C, arrogance, bureaucracy or complacency. If you put your head in the sand, you die. I think that I'm just trying to note that, I think JPMorgan is in pretty good shape. I think your competition is going to be brutal and fun to watch. And I think there'll be a lot of losers in it too, by the way.

Unidentified Analyst

You've written about the need for a level playing field between banks and new entrants?

Jamie Dimon

I didn't say that, I simply because we're not going to get a level playing field. I don't expect, the regulars aren't going to change anything on banks at this point. But what I was pointing out is that among the things we have to deal with is we have capital requirements. Some of these people don't, we have liquidity requirements some of these people don't, we've got social requirements, people don't, we got AML KYC, which they have in some capacity, but they don't, we've got insurance requirements they don't, we've got resolution requirements, they don't, we've got that's I am just pointing out the truth. It is what it is. Just acknowledge it, that's all and if they ever want to change, change it then let them change. I can't rely on any of those things being changed, has been 10 years since Basel, talking about Basel IV. And we still know what it is. So, that creates uncertainty for banks. I know it's not what I like, but that's my lot in life. I got to deal with it.

Unidentified Analyst

On the consumer side, Marianne and Jen touched a bit on this last week, you reach over 66 million American households, got a dominant footprint in retail banking. What's the strategy to connect with the younger generation as they begin to build wealth and connect with them on broader levels?

Jamie Dimon

Yes, well I think I've got the numbers they put up there, but we already have a huge share of Gen Z and Millennials. So, it isn't like we're missing anything. And they like our product, like our service, like our sapphire card. And then, we added things like self directed investing, which we acknowledged, we didn't have the best platform of all but it's already up to $50 billion or $60 billion, so it's there, so you can now go on your phone and we got to make it easy for you, we got to add a bunch of stuff that you know other people have. So, we have your account, we got your deposit, you get your credit journey, you get free bill pay, you get free risk rewards, you get free offers, you get free this, you get free trading, it's pretty good. So, we're trying to work for the customer more and more, which will appeal to customers in general. We're not trying to game a fight or anything like that, but we want to be there for customers younger and older. And so, and I think we've been quite successful at it, and more to come. I think some of these things, Marianne just gave you a snippet of travel and offers more to come.

Unidentified Analyst

Could you touch on the credit card environment and how you differentiate as a credit card issuer and a payments provider in a very competitive environment, and maybe what you're doing with travel and some of the engagement stuff?

Jamie Dimon

Yes, so payments, I think payments is kind of probably the most challenged, people talk about like, like it's old, it's not old challenged, JPMorgan moved $7 trillion, $10 trillion a day around the world, very cheap, very effective through our AML systems, or BSA systems, or risk of fraud systems, 99.9999 accuracy and all that. But some parts are charged, we are trying to move money overseas. So, people looking at that whole ecosystem and trying to reduce their cost and the price to merchants or consumers. And we have to make sure we do that, too.

I just I think it's a whole thing. And obviously, credit card on the consumer side, credit card, debit card, and all the other payment systems, ACH and Wires and all that make it easier and better for customers, which we intend to do. So, on credit card, we've got the brand, our brand Sapphire, Chase cards and, and things like that. And then, we got wonderful co-brands, Southwest, United, great partner companies that kind of enhance our system of travels and stuff like that. So, what we want to do is give you better travel packages and better rewards programs and better offers that are more targeted to you, more personalized in a way that you really like using both platforms. And we're convinced, it's a great strategy, and we have to execute, but I think you're going to see that, early, late this year, early next year, some really neat stuff coming.

And then just more broadly on technology, the cost of it and the benefits of it, right.

Jamie Dimon

That's the other thing, by the way, it's about data, we protect people's data and privacy. And a lot of other people out there in the finance, they're selling that data all the time. We don't, we're not allowed to, but we can use it to help you on risk of fraud or marketing. And we can partner with someone without giving away data where we can offer you something better. And so, that, that is both a plus and a minus, how you look at how things get to use data and stuff like that. So, that will be a big asset, I think hopefully one day.

Unidentified Analyst

And you've touched on this in the past. But could you help us kind of demystify a little bit what moving to the cloud means for JPMorgan?

Jamie Dimon

Yes, well we've been writing about for years, digital, cloud, and AI are they're all related. And they're real. Okay, the cloud allows you to do enormous compute, I think Lori Beer gave a thing that would go from like one server to 14,000 servers to do a bunch of calculations all the way down to that one, can't even do that in our big data centers and it's unbelievable compute, that compute, when you can access multiple databases in a split second to do something for you for risk of fraud or marketing is extraordinary.

That compute power was in the private cloud or the public cloud. So, you have to put, you can put stuff in the public cloud that you need unbelievable compute, stuff which you don't need it, it's very steady, you don't have to, it's all different. But you have to spend the time to re-factor and re-platform data and apps. So, they're cloud eligible, it's in the private cloud or the public cloud, the new data says we have, we're going to reduce the operating costs, the actual operating costs of running something by 20%, 30% or 40% and make it accessible to machine learning and stuff like that, because we can do machine learning in our own data centers or in the public cloud. So, that's a journey, I tell people you really want to do as a constant innovate, a lot of stuff is already in the cloud already has AI ML and some of the stuff you may never do, like the certain mainframe applications, you're going to run it just that way and you retire one day or build a new cloud eligible one, but a lot of stuff has already been put in the cloud. So, you may not change the mainframe, but all the stuff at Digital, compute AI ML, you're slowly moving the cloud to so I say innovate, but it's a slog. It's like hard work to get all this stuff there. You could have any company that does it and but you need to do it. And if you don't do it, right, you'll be at a huge disadvantage down the road.

How hard is it for smaller banks to compete and as we've seen the consolidation of certain products like mortgages and credit cards and do you see deposits getting consolidated into the hands of bigger banks and other products as well? And is there still a role for smaller banks?

Jamie Dimon

Yes, look I think you're going to see a lot of consolidation. I think they need it, I mean, I think you need to kind of just scale as you know, consolidation is really hard to social names and consolidating systems, and then you're going to have a lot of people, third-parties, who offer Cloud based type of benefits to smaller banks. So, it isn't like they can't have them at all, they're going to get them third-party, someone's third-party.

Now, I could tell any names and stuff like that ahead of others, some of the banks are doing it, some don't, I always think a very well run Community Bank or regional bank can do well, it's just going to be very well run, you got local knowledge and local people, local authority, and they sit in the local boards, and they, but they have to accommodate it too, because clients do walk with their feet, they've got to offer these, some of these great services and products to their clients too. And it's not possible. I mean, if you look at the world out there, all these FinTech companies, if you combine them all have 400 million, 500 million, 600 million accounts in America, they own 150 million households.

So, you take them all, they've got their rent. So, JPMorgan have 66 million, we have all these deposits, but there's this, there's these people chipping away at every single piece of it, we can't hold when, it's not possible. And what you see now is like and you see people are like FinTechs are deepening, some will let you know, it's very easy to cherry pick. So, I remember [indiscernible] was first coming out and said, ""Oh, student loans,"" the price was one was the same for everybody. But I'll take your student loan, if you went to Harvard, Princeton, or Yale, little did they know how little that meant, but seriously they were just cherry picking credit. That's in not in my whole life. Now they want your investment account, your checking account, your debit account, your this account, that means they have to compete with us too. That's a whole different ballgame for them. But we'll see, some will do it well, and some won't. And the squares done a great job and a whole bunch of different stuff, but then is if they charge customers take your money out, their revenue stream is charging you 1.5% to take your money out. We don't charge you to take your money out or put it in. So, we have huge competitive advantages. And I have enormous respect for them, I'm not sure that's how sustainable that model is. Some of it, they're building so much stuff so quickly. They're just they're out there bobbing and weaving and very good at it. And my hat's off to them.

Great, a couple of minutes left, a few questions here from the audience. The first one was, can you talk broadly about how you're thinking about your business and footprint in Asia over the next few years and what kind of growth investments you're making there?

Jamie Dimon

It's the same, and I think we put some charts up there than commercial banking we've opened offices in Asia to do more. Think of not middle market, but corporate type of banking businesses, which I would put in the low risk category, by the way, but it's country by country. There are plans for every country out there. And we want a certain share of corporate business and financial institutions business and payments businesses and trading businesses. It is country by country. Obviously, the big one is China and India, the big ones Greater China and India, so our plans in China is pretty much the same. We've got our full licenses. We're growing carefully. And same with India though, it's hard to do business in India too. So, nothing much changed or just continue to grow there. And I think huge opportunity over time, and obviously, Asia is going to grow faster than the rest of the world for quite a while.

Unidentified Analyst

Just from an ESG perspective, you were Chairman of the Business Roundtable a few years ago and kind of led the effort to re-conceptualize Corporation suited to serve all stakeholders, or banks, or banks doing on that. How's JPMorgan doing?

Jamie Dimon

First of all, just I am a red blooded free market capitalist, and I'm not woke, and I think people are mistaking the shareholder, stakeholder capitalism thing for being woke. But all we basically said for stakeholder capitalism is when you say to me, when you say the American forget you all, okay there's 325 million Americans. And when you say shareholder value, and fiduciary responsibility, they hear short-term profit taking at the expense of employees or customers. And fiduciary, they hear white shoe high paid lawyers, protecting CEOs.

All we're saying is when we wake up in the morning, what we give a shit about is serving customers earning their respect, earning their repeat business and we do that through employees and that's what we do and obviously we want to earn shareholder value, so it's just why should we get buttonholed into a stupid legal debate, so all your General Counsels, you are going to say, your fiduciary, yes so what? Explain to the American public what you do and why you do it, and of course, and when we do things like we're quite serious about climate I don't think America is getting climate right, I think the chances getting right is virtually nil. I don't think we remotely understand the complexity of this. And we can't turn on electricity from hydroelectric power much less, and then we're going to reduce oil and gas, which is going to cause more CO2, and we're just -- we're not getting it right because it's an uncoordinated -- we're confused between hugging trees and yelling at lending, and they're -- it's just way off base, there's no -- we need real leadership in this area, and we're not getting it.

And so -- and then other stuff, we --- like we -- we want -- if you're an employee of ours, and whether you're black or white, Jewish or Muslim, Indian, Asian, disabled, LGBT+; we want you to be treated with respect in our company. We want to give you opportunity. That's not woke, that's -- what I want from my -- what we want for you, that you can contribute to the company the best of your ability. So, any senator or congressman says that's woke, they're not thinking clearly, because I want to win in the marketplace, I want the best employees, I want happy employees. And so, but some of the other stuff we don't get involved in because it's -- it is woke, you know that I don't think people should get involved in some of these issues where it's far more detailed than you think, and people are just getting jazzed up about, ""You got to do this, and you got to,"" no, you don't, no you don't.

You know, so I agree with it. I think some people are overdoing it. And I think like -- I think like -- I mentioned these -- this hurricane. Part of the hurricane is the high oil prices, which I think are in the cards. And I just -- I'm watching that train coming down the tracks, and I'm very sad about it. I don't know, I wake up every morning, I'm quite sad about it.

This is the last question, in terms of succession, succession planning. You know, it sounds like you're going to be in the seat as the leader of JPMorgan Chase for four-plus more years. How is the Board using that time to prepare your succession --

Jamie Dimon

Yes. So, it's totally -- remember, it's totally up to the Board. And so, whatever -- anything I say, it's up to the Board. I have 10 board members who decide every day whether they want me in the shop or not. I'm an employee at will; they could fire me tomorrow. I think -- when I went up to Fidelity and Wellington, I explained to them that the most important thing, and I think sometimes the press misses this too, is does the Board meet without the chairman and CEO all the time, not is there a chairman and CEO. My -- the lead director has all the authority of a chairman. They meet every single time since I got the Bank One; it's not required by law. Now, it's required, I think, once a year in a Dodd-Frank.

But I have insisted every single time they hear -- they get full access to the management team, full access to everything. They go play golf with them, they could have lunch with them, they meet, not just by direct reports, they know them well, but they meet the next layers down. And they meet every single time without me, and they have, since 2000. And they have an open conversation about what's working, what's not working, what feedbacks we give Jamie, what are we happy with, we're not happy with. And that's what they do. That is the most important thing.

And while I'm making a pitch to you all, you -- corporate America has a problem, okay? And the problem - and I think investors have to do this; I can't. So, think of asset managers, we've gone from 7,200 public companies in 1996, and this may be a real problem; I'm begging you to pay attention to it when you go home, okay? We've got 7,200 to [expats] [Ph] like 4,200. Now, that number should have gone from 7,000 to 14,000. And what happened? Well, private equity, I'm only talking about the big ones, because I can't even add up all the smaller ones who's gone. I'm not against private equity, I'm just pointing out some facts, has gone from only 1,000 to 10,000 companies.

And all this other capital is moving private. I'm not against private capital; I'm not against private equity. I'm just wondering why that's taking place. And you'd think someone would be thinking about what do you want in America. You want active public mortgage. And we're driving companies out of the public markets because of litigation, regulation, press, cookie-cutter governance, you know, ""Oh you got to have this amount of directors, and this amount of that,"" and who said so? What's wrong with a free market system where you -- UC companies. I mean what's independent mean? And Warren Buffett will tell you independence -- independent-minded, you know, it's not anything else. If you rely on fees you're not independent, you know.

So, we -- and so, with private equity, management teams focus on the business, boards focus on the business. They're not -- they can -- they could come up with the kind of schemes they think work the best for that business. They don't have to deal with Glass Lewis and ISS, which shame on you if any of you -- if that's how you vote, shame on you. I mean, seriously, you should be embarrassed, okay. And do your own homework. And the shit I hear from people about, ""Well, you know, there's too many [prime] [Ph],"" no, there's not. If you own a hundred companies, the average proxies got six, that's 600, there maybe ten to matter. And like even that, you know, so we talked to our investors, and we send up -- I don't do it, the lead director does and stuff like that, so the lead director goes up there and they talk to a 27-year-old compliance officer, who writes a memo, and then votes Glass Lewis. I think if we send up a director of ours who is a decision-maker, they should send someone who is a decision-maker. And you should be able to say to that person on the spot you got my vote or you don't, as opposed we have to wait to proxy day. And I just think we are just slowly destroying Corporate America for all the wrong reasons. And if you don't fix it, folks, you better go private too, because there will be no public companies. I don't use Good for America, because I think our active transparent mortgage are great. They had been one of the engines. With all the flaws we've had, they had been one of the engines here. So, I'm begging you. I'm begging you, don't allow this to happen with [technical difficulty] -- figure out what it's got like in ten years, and see if that's acceptable, because in my view it's not.

Jamie Dimon denies knowledge of JPMorgan concerns over Epstein in lawsuit deposition,
,"New York CNN —

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has denied knowing about internal reviews of Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal conduct and his account with the bank when they were happening.

Dimon made the remarks in a deposition for lawsuits against the bank related to its alleged role in Epstein’s sex trafficking crimes.

He sat for the deposition for about eight hours last Friday, according to a redacted transcript of it obtained by CNN.

The parties agreed to release the deposition transcript, which was initially confidential.

Attorneys for opposing parties in a collection of related lawsuits with JPMorgan, including a victim of Epstein, the government of the US Virgin Islands and former JPMorgan executive James “Jes” Staley pressed Dimon on his firsthand knowledge of Epstein’s affairs during his longtime relationship with the bank, which wasn’t severed until 2013.

An anonymous victim of Epstein working to bring a class action suit against the bank and the government of the US Virgin Islands are suing JPMorgan Chase for allegedly enabling and financially benefiting from Epstein’s sex trafficking crimes.

The financial institution has also sued Staley, known to be a friend to Epstein, alleging he is to blame for the bank’s 15-year relationship with Epstein. Staley has denied all wrongdoing alleged in the lawsuits.

Dimon testified that he had never personally met or spoken over the phone with Epstein.

The CEO, who’s been in executive leadership for over two decades, testified that he was not aware in real time of bank compliance evaluations of Epstein’s account and his criminal conduct dating back to 2006.

Dimon testified that he was not really aware of Epstein’s criminal history and relationship with the bank until he saw news stories in 2019 around the time of Epstein’s arrest on federal charges in New York.

“And the reason I remember that is I was surprised that I didn’t know about it before,” he said, according to the transcript.

Dimon did acknowledge that he’s now aware that some JPMorgan employees knew Epstein was charged with sex crimes involving cash and that he was moving large cash amounts in his bank accounts in 2007.

“When you say ‘JPMorgan knew,’ yes, there were people here who obviously knew some of that, yes,” he said.

Epstein was identified on an internal compliance list of high-risk clients with criminal records dated October 2006, the deposition transcript shows.

The chart indicated the reason Epstein was high-risk because: “Several newspaper articles were found that detail the indictment of Jeffrey Epstein in Florida on felony charges of soliciting underage prostitutes.”

The chart also noted that bank personnel opted to retain him as a client, according to the transcript.

Other records reviewed during the deposition show that compliance personnel and the bank’s legal team repeatedly evaluated Epstein’s status as a client but approved his account year after year.

Dimon testified that the bank’s general counsel would have had the final say to cut ties with a client like Epstein.

In a 2011 email referring to Epstein and reviewed during the deposition, JPMorgan’s then-general counsel, Steve Cutler wrote: “This is not an honorable person in any way. He should not be a client.”

Dimon said he didn’t know the bank’s lead attorney felt that way at the time.

Cutler testified in a deposition related to the ongoing litigation that Jes Staley and another executive running the bank’s asset and wealth management unit, Mary Erdoes, made the decision to retain Epstein as a customer, the transcript says.

According to Dimon, Staley and Erdoes could not have overridden the general counsel.

“Mr. Cutler had the ultimate authority to kick him out if he thought it had gone that far. He was delegating reputational decisions to somebody else,” Dimon said.

Attorney Brad Edwards, who represents an anonymous Epstein victim in her lawsuit against the bank, said it doesn’t matter which employee is at fault.

“What has become clear is that Epstein could not have run his sex trafficking operation without the valuable assistance of JPMorgan, Chase. Conveniently, each banker points a finger at the other, claiming this hot potato was someone else’s fault. Regardless how unbelievable the finger-pointing or purported lack of knowledge is, responsibility rests with the bank,” Edwards said in a statement to CNN.

While maintaining that the bank had not committed any crimes, Dimon said he “wouldn’t mind” apologizing to Epstein’s victims.

“I think what happened to these women is atrocious, and I’m horrified at the amount of human trafficking that takes place. And I wouldn’t mind personally apologizing to them, not because we committed the crime, we did not, and not because we believe we’re responsible, but that any potential thing, what little role that we could have eased it or helped catch it quicker or something like that, or get it to law enforcement quicker or get law enforcement to react to it quicker, which they obviously didn’t, you know, I would apologize to them for that, yes,” Dimon testified.

A JPMorgan spokesperson said in a Wednesday statement to CNN: “Had the Firm believed he was engaged in an ongoing sex trafficking operation, Epstein would not have been retained as client. In hindsight, we regret he was ever a client.”

Dimon was asked several questions during the deposition about an April interview with CNN’s Poppy Harlow in which he said “Hindsight is a fabulous gift.” He was asked if he thought the bank should have terminated Epstein as a client years earlier.

He testified that he didn’t learn about most of the salacious details of Epstein’s affairs and JPMorgan’s awareness of the situation until he began to prepare for the deposition in connection with the lawsuits.

Dimon said he didn’t recall if he learned that lawyers and compliance employees at JPMorgan did not support retaining Epstein as a customer before the CNN interview."
